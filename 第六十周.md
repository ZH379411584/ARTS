树结构的处理，使用最简单的树（树高只有一层或者两层）来写基本逻辑，然后将左子树看做一个新树，左子树就是新树的父节点。

#### [The Linker Is not a Magical Program 链接器不是一个神奇的程序](https://97-things-every-x-should-know.gitbooks.io/97-things-every-programmer-should-know/content/en/thing_53/)
Depressingly often (happened to me again just before I wrote this), the view many programmers have of the process of going from source code to a statically linked executable in a compiled language is:
1. Edit source code
2. Compile source code into object files
3. Something magical happens
4. Run executable
Step 3 is, of course, the linking step. Why would I say such an outrageous(令人发指) thing? I've been doing tech support for decades, and I get the following questions again and again:
1. The linker says def is defined more than once.
2. The linker says abc is an unresolved symbol.
3. Why is my executable so large?
Followed by "What do I do now?" usually with the phrases "seems to" and "somehow" mixed in, and an aura of utter bafflement. It's the "seems to" and "somehow" that indicate that the linking process is viewed as a magical process, presumably understandable only by wizards and warlocks(大概只有巫师和术士才能理解). The process of compiling does not elicit(引出) these kinds of phrases, implying that programmers generally understand how compilers work, or at least what they do.

A linker is a very stupid, pedestrian, straightforward program. All it does is concatenate(连接) together the code and data sections of the object files, connect the references to symbols with their definitions, pull unresolved symbols out of the library, and write out an executable. That's it. No spells! No magic! The tedium(乏味的) in writing a linker is usually all about decoding and generating the usually ridiculously(可笑的) overcomplicated(过于复杂) file formats, but that doesn't change the essential nature of a linker.

So let's say the linker is saying def is defined more than once. Many programming languages, such as C, C++, and D, have both declarations and definitions. Declarations normally go into header files, like:
```
extern int iii;

```
which generates an external reference to the symbol iii. A definition, on the other hand, actually sets aside storage for the symbol, usually appears in the implementation file, and looks like this:
```
int iii = 3;

```
How many definitions can there be for each symbol? As in the film Highlander, there can be only one. So, what if a definition of iii appears in more than one implementation file?
```
// File a.c
int iii = 3;
```
```
// File b.c
double iii(int x) { return 3.7; }
```
The linker will complain about iii being multiply defined.

Not only can there be only one, there must be one. If iii only appears as a declaration, but never a definition, the linker will complain about iii being an unresolved symbol.

To determine why an executable is the size it is, take a look at the map file that linkers optionally generate. A map file is nothing more than a list of all the symbols in the executable along with their addresses. This tells you what modules were linked in from the library, and the sizes of each module. Now you can see where the bloat(膨胀) is coming from. Often there will be library modules that you have no idea why were linked in. To figure it out, temporarily remove the suspicious(可疑) module from the library, and relink. The undefined symbol error then generated will indicate who is referencing that module.

Although it is not always immediately obvious why you get a particular linker message, there is nothing magical about linkers. The mechanics are straightforward; it's the details you have to figure out in each case.

#### [The Longevity of Interim Solutions 临时解决方案的寿命](https://97-things-every-x-should-know.gitbooks.io/97-things-every-programmer-should-know/content/en/thing_54/)
Why do we create interim solutions?

Typically there is some immediate problem to solve. It might be internal to the development team, some tooling that fills a gap in the tool chain. It might be external, visible to end users, such as a workaround（解决方法） that addresses missing functionality.

In most systems and teams you will find some software that is somewhat dis-integrated（瓦解） from the system, that is considered a draft（草案） to be changed sometime, that does not follow the standards and guidelines that shaped the rest of the code. Inevitably（不可避免地） you will hear developers complaining about these. The reasons for their creation are many and varied, but the key to an interim solution's success is simple: It is useful.

Interim solutions, however, acquire inertia（惯性） (or momentum, depending on your point of view). Because they are there, ultimately（最终） useful and widely accepted, there is no immediate need to do anything else. Whenever a stakeholder（利益相关者） has to decide what action adds the most value, there will be many that are ranked higher than proper integration of an interim solution. Why? Because it is there, it works, and it is accepted. The only perceived downside（感知到的缺点） is that it does not follow the chosen standards and guidelines — except for a few niche markets, this is not considered to be a significant force.（强大的力量。）

So the interim solution remains in place. Forever.

And if problems arise with that interim solution, it is unlikely there will be provision（规定） for an update that brings it into line with accepted production quality. What to do? A quick interim update on that interim solution often does the job. And will most likely be well received. It exhibits the same strengths as the initial interim solution... it is just more up to date.

Is this a problem?

The answer depends on your project, and on your personal stake in the production code standards. When the systems contains too many interim solutions, its entropy or internal complexity grows and its maintainability decreases. However, this is probably the wrong question to ask first. Remember that we are talking about a solution. It may not be your preferred（首要） solution — it is unlikely to be anyone's preferred solution — but the motivation to rework this solution is weak.

So what can we do if we see a problem?

1. Avoid creating an interim solution in the first place.
2. Change the forces that influence the decision of the project manager.
3. Leave it as is.
Let's examine these options more closely:
1. Avoidance（规定） does not work in most places. There is an actual problem to solve, and the standards have turned out to be too restrictive（限制性的）. You might spend some energy trying to change the standards. An honorable albeit tedious endeavor... and that change will not be effective in time for your problem at hand.
2. The forces are rooted（根植于） in the project culture, which resists volitional（自愿的） change. It could be successful in very small projects — especially if it's just you — and you just happen to clean the mess without asking in advance. It could also be successful if the project is such a mess that it is visibly stalled and some time for cleaning up is commonly accepted.
3. The status quo automatically applies if the previous option does not.

You will create many solutions, some of them will be interim, most of them will be useful. The best way to overcome interim solutions is to make them superfluous（多余）, to provide a more elegant and useful solution. May you be granted the serenity（宁静） to accept the things you cannot change, courage to change the things you can, and wisdom to know the difference.
