#### [Two Wrongs Can Make a Right (and Are Difficult to Fix)](https://97-things-every-x-should-know.gitbooks.io/97-things-every-programmer-should-know/content/en/thing_86/)
Code never lies, but it can contradict itself. Some contradictions lead to those "How can that possibly work?" moments.

In an interview, the principal designer of the Apollo 11 Lunar Module software, Allan Klumpp, disclosed that the software controlling the engines contained a bug that should have made the lander unstable. However, another bug compensated(补偿的) for the first and the software was used for both Apollo 11 and 12 Moon landings before either bug was found or fixed.

Consider a function that returns a completion status. Imagine that it returns false when it should return true. Now imagine the calling function neglects to check the return value. Everything works fine until one day someone notices the missing check and inserts it.

Or consider an application that stores state as an XML document. Imagine that one of the nodes in incorrectly written as TimeToLive instead of TimeToDie, as the documentation says it should. Everything appears fine while the writer code and the reader code both contain the same error. But fix one, or add a new application reading the same document, and the symmetry(对称) is broken, as well as the code.

When two defects(缺陷) in the code create one visible fault, the methodical(有条不紊) approach to fixing faults can itself break down. The developer gets a bug report, finds the defect, fixes it, and retests. The reported fault still occurs, however, because a second defect is at work. So the first fix is removed, the code inspected until the second underlying defect is found, and a fix applied for that. But the first defect has returned, the reported fault is still seen, and so the second fix is rolled back. The process repeats but now the developer has dismissed(被解雇) two possible fixes and is looking to make a third that will never work.
The interplay（相互作用） between two code defects that appear as one visible fault not only makes it hard to fix the problem but leads developers down blind alleys, only to find they tried the right answers early on.

This doesn't happen only in code: The problem also exists in written requirements documents. And it can spread, virally, from one place to another. An error in the code compensates（补偿） for an error in the written description.

It can spread to people too: Users learn that when the application says Left it means Right, so they adjust their behavior accordingly. They even pass it on to new users: "Remember when that applications says click the left button it really means the button on the right." Fix the bug and suddenly the users need retraining.
Single wrongs can be easy to spot and easy to fix. It is the problems with multiple causes, needing multiple changes, that are harder to resolve. In part it is because easy problems are so easily fixed that people tend to fix them relatively quickly and store up the more difficult problems for a later date.

There is no simple advice to give on how to address（解决） faults arising from sympathetic defects. Awareness of the possibility, a clear head, and a willingness（愿意） to consider all possibilities are needed.

So often we write code in isolation and the code reflects our personal interpretation of a problem, as well as a very personalized solution. We may be part of the team, yet we are isolated, as is the team. We forget all too easily that this code created in isolation will be executed, used, extended, and relied upon by others. It is easy to overlook the social side of software creation. Creating software is a technical(技术) exercise mixed into a social exercise. We just need to lift our heads more often to realize that we are not working in isolation, and we have shared responsibility towards increasing the probability of success for everyone, not just the development team.

You can write good quality code in isolation, all the while lost in self. From one perspective, that is an egocentric(以自我为中心) approach (not ego(自我) as in arrogant（傲慢）, but ego as in personal). It is also a Zen view and it is about you, in that moment of creating code. I always try to live in the moment because it helps me get closer to good quality, but then I live in my moment. What about the moment of my team? Is my moment the same as the team's moment?

In Zulu, the philosophy of Ubuntu is summed（总结） up as "Umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu" which roughly translates to "A person is a person through (other) persons." I get better because you make me better through your good actions. The flip side is that you get worse at what you do when I am bad at what I do. Among developers, we can narrow it down to "A developer is a developer through (other) developers." If we take it down to the metal, then "Code is code through (other) code."

The quality of the code I write affects the quality of the code you write. What if my code is of poor quality? Even if you write very clean code, it is the points where you use my code that your code quality will degrade to close to the quality of my code. You can apply many patterns and techniques to limit the damage, but the damage has already been done. I have caused you to do more than what you needed to do simply because I did not think about you when I was living in my moment.

I may consider my code to be clean, but I can still make it better just by Ubuntu coding. What does Ubuntu code look like? It looks just like good clean code. It is not about the code, the artifact. It is about the act of creating that artifact. Coding for your friends, with Ubuntu, will help your team live your values and reinforce your principles. The next person that touches your code, in whatever way, will be a better person and a better developer.

Zen is about the individual. Ubuntu is about Zen for a group of people. Very, very rarely do we create code for ourselves alone.

写代码不要沉迷自我，要考虑别人如何依赖你的代码。

#### [The Unix Tools Are Your Friends](https://97-things-every-x-should-know.gitbooks.io/97-things-every-programmer-should-know/content/en/thing_88/)

If on my way to exile(流亡) on a desert island I had to choose between an IDE and the Unix toolchest, I'd pick the Unix tools without a second thought. Here are the reasons why you should become proficient with Unix tools.

First, IDEs target specific languages, while Unix tools can work with anything that appears in textual(文字的) form. In today's development environment where new languages and notations spring up every year, learning to work in the Unix way is an investment that will pay off time and again.

Furthermore, while IDEs offer just the commands their developers conceived(构思), with Unix tools you can perform any task you can imagine. Think of them as (classic pre-Bionicle) Lego blocks: You create your own commands simply by combining the small but versatile Unix tools. For instance, the following sequence is a text-based implementation of Cunningham's signature analysis — a sequence of each file's semicolons, braces, and quotes, which can reveal a lot about the file's contents.

```
for i in *.java; do 
    echo -n "$i: "
    sed 's/[^"{};]//g' $i | tr -d '\n'
    echo
done
```

In addition, each IDE operation you learn is specific to that given task; for instance, adding a new step in a project's debug build configuration. By contrast, sharpening your Unix tool skills makes you more effective at any task. As an example, I've employed the sed tool used in the preceding command sequence to morph a project's build for cross-compiling on multiple processor architectures.

Unix tools were developed in an age when a multiuser computer had 128kB of RAM. The ingenuity that went into their design means that nowadays they can handle huge data sets extremely efficiently. Most tools work like filters, processing just a single line at the time, meaning that there is no upper limit in the amount of data they can handle. You want to search for the number of edits stored in the half-terabyte English Wikipedia dump? A simple invocation of
```
grep '<revision>' | wc –l

```
will give you the answer without sweat. If you find a command sequence generally useful, you can easily package it into a shell script, using some uniquely powerful programming constructs, such as piping data into loops and conditionals. Even more impressively, Unix commands executing as pipelines, like the preceding one, will naturally distribute(分发) their load among the many processing units of modern multicore CPUs.

The small-is-beautiful provenance（起源） and open source implementations of the Unix tools make them ubiquitously（无处不在） available, even on resource-constrained platforms, like my set-top media player or DSL router. Such devices are unlikely to offer a powerful graphical user interface, but they often include the BusyBox application, which provides the most commonly-used tools. And if you are developing on Windows, the Cygwin environment offers you all imaginable Unix tools, both as executables and in source code form.

Finally, if none of the available tools match your needs, it's very easy to extend the world of the Unix tools. Just write a program (in any language you fancy) that plays by a few simple rules: Your program should perform just a single task; it should read data as text lines from its standard input; and it should display its results unadorned by headers and other noise on its standard output. Parameters affecting the tool's operation are given in the command line. Follow these rules and "yours is the Earth and everything that's in it."

unix命令是你的朋友  
1. IDE 针对某一种语言，unix工具 可以处理任何以文字形式展示的数据。
2. IDE 只提供那些开发IDE构思的命令，Unix工具可以执行您可以想象的任何任务。
