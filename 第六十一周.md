#### [Make the Invisible More Visible](https://97-things-every-x-should-know.gitbooks.io/97-things-every-programmer-should-know/content/en/thing_56/)
Many aspects of invisibility are rightly lauded as software principles to uphold. Our terminology is rich in invisibility metaphors — mechanism transparency(机制透明) and information hiding, to name but two. Software and the process of developing it can be, to paraphrase Douglas Adams, mostly invisible:

- Source code has no innate(先天的) presence, no innate behavior, and doesn't obey the laws of physics. It's visible when you load it into an editor, but close the editor and it's gone. Think about it too long and, like the tree falling down with no one to hear it, you start to wonder if it exists at all.
- A running application has presence and behavior, but reveals(透露) nothing of the source code it was built from. Google's home page is pleasingly minimal; the goings on behind it are surely substantial.
- If you're 90% done and endlessly stuck trying to debug your way through the last 10% then you're not 90% done, are you? Fixing bugs is not making progress. You aren't paid to debug. Debugging is waste. It's good to make waste more visible so you can see it for what it is and start thinking about trying not to create it in the first place.
- If your project is apparently（显然地） on track and one week later it's six months late you have problems, the biggest of which is probably not that it's six months late, but the invisibility force fields powerful enough to hide six months of lateness! Lack of visible progress is synonymous with lack of progress.

Invisibility can be dangerous. You think more clearly when you have something concrete to tie your thinking to. You manage things better when you can see them and see them constantly changing:

- Writing unit tests provides evidence about how easy the code unit is to unit test. It helps reveal（揭示） the presence (or absence) of developmental qualities you'd like the code to exhibit; qualities such as low coupling（低耦合） and high cohesion（高内聚）.

- Running unit tests provides evidence about the code's behavior. It helps reveal the presence (or absence) of runtime of qualities you'd like the application to exhibit; qualities such as robustness and correctness（健壮性和正确性）.

- Using bulletin boards and cards（公告板和卡片） makes progress visible and concrete. Tasks can be seen as Not Started, In Progress, or Done without reference to a hidden project management tool and without having to chase programmers for fictional（虚构） status reports.

- Doing incremental development increases the visibility of development progress (or lack of it) by increasing the frequency of development evidence. Completion of releasable software reveals（显示） reality; estimates do not.

It's best to develop software with plenty of regular visible evidence. Visibility gives confidence that progress is genuine and not an illusion, deliberate and not unintentional, repeatable and not accidental.

#### [Message Passing Leads to Better Scalability in Parallel Systems 消息传递可提高并行系统的可伸缩性](https://97-things-every-x-should-know.gitbooks.io/97-things-every-programmer-should-know/content/en/thing_57/)
Programmers are taught from the very outset(一开始) of their study of computing that concurrency — and especially parallelism（并行性）, a special subset of concurrency — is hard, that only the very best can ever hope to get it right, and even they get it wrong. There is invariably（总是） great focus on threads, semaphores, monitors, and how hard it is to get concurrent access to variables to be thread-safe.

True, there are many difficult problems, and they can be very hard to solve. But what is the root of the problem? Shared memory. Almost all the problems of concurrency that people go on and on about relate to the use of shared mutable memory: race conditions, deadlock, livelock, etc. The answer seems obvious: Either forgo concurrency or eschew shared memory!（要么放弃并发，要么避免共享内存！）

Forgoing concurrency is almost certainly not an option. Computers have more and more cores on an almost quarterly basis, so harnessing (驾驭)true parallelism becomes more and more important. We can no longer rely on ever increasing processor clock speeds to improve application performance. Only by exploiting parallelism will the performance of applications improve. Obviously, not improving performance is an option, but it is unlikely to be acceptable to users.

So can we eschew（避开） shared memory? Definitely.

Instead of using threads and shared memory as our programming model, we can use processes and message passing. Process here just means a protected independent state with executing code, not necessarily an operating system process. Languages such as Erlang (and occam before it) have shown that processes are a very successful mechanism for programming concurrent and parallel systems. Such systems do not have all the synchronization stresses that shared memory, multi-threaded systems have. Moreover there is a formal model — Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) — that can be applied as part of the engineering of such systems.

We can go further and introduce dataflow systems as a way of computing. In a dataflow system there is no explicitly programmed control flow. Instead a directed graph of operators, connected by data paths, is set up and then data fed into the system. Evaluation is controlled by the readiness of data within the system. Definitely no synchronization problems.

Having said all this, languages such as C, C++, Java, Python, and Groovy are the principal languages of systems development and all of these are presented to programmers as languages for developing shared memory, multi-threaded systems. So what can be done? The answer is to use — or, if they don't exist, create — libraries and frameworks that provide process models and message passing, avoiding all use of shared mutable memory.

All in all, not programming with shared memory, but instead using message passing, is likely to be the most successful way of implementing systems that harness the parallelism that is now endemic in computer hardware. Bizarrely perhaps, although processes predate（作为） threads as a unit of concurrency, the future seems to be in using threads to implement processes.

并行难以处理，核心的问题是内存共享导致的。使用进程和消息。（这里的进程仅表示具有执行代码的受保护的独立状态，而不一定是操作系统进程。）

#### [A Message to the Future](https://97-things-every-x-should-know.gitbooks.io/97-things-every-programmer-should-know/content/en/thing_58/)

Maybe it's because most of them are smart people, but in all the years I've taught and worked side-by-side with programmers, it seems that most of them thought that since the problems they were struggling with were difficult that the solutions should be just as difficult for everyone (maybe even for themselves a few months after the code was written) to understand and maintain.

I remember one incident with Joe, a student in my data structures class, who had to come in to show me what he'd written. "Betcha can't guess what it does!" he crowed.

"You're right," I agreed without spending too much time on his example and wondering how to get an important message across. "I'm sure you've been working hard on this. I wonder, though, if you haven't forgotten something important. Say, Joe, don't you have a younger brother?"

"Yep. Sure do! Phil! He's in your Intro class. He's learning to program, too!" Joe announced proudly. "That's great," I replied. "I wonder if he could read this code."

"No way!" said Joe. "This is hard stuff!"

"Just suppose," I suggested, "that this was real working code and that in a few years Phil was hired to make a maintenance update. What have you done for him?" Joe just stared at me blinking. "We know that Phil is really smart, right?" Joe nodded. "And I hate to say it, but I'm pretty smart, too!" Joe grinned. "So if I can't easily understand what you've done here and your very smart younger brother will likely puzzle over this, what does that mean about what you've written?" Joe looked at his code a little differently it seemed to me. "How about this," I suggested in my best 'I'm your friendly mentor' voice, "Think of every line of code you write as a message for someone in the future — someone who might be your younger brother. Pretend you're explaining to this smart person how to solve this tough problem.

"Is this what you'd like to imagine? That the smart programmer in the future would see your code and say, 'Wow! This is great! I can understand perfectly what's been done here and I'm amazed at what an elegant — no, wait — what a beautiful piece of code this is. I'm going to show the other folks on my team. This is a masterpiece!'

"Joe, do you think you can write code that solves this difficult problem but will be so beautiful it will sing? Yes, just like a haunting melody. I think that anyone who can come up with the very difficult solution you have here could also write something beautiful. Hmm... I wonder if I should start grading on beauty? What do you think, Joe?"

Joe picked up his work and looked at me, a little smile creeping across his face. "I got it, prof, I'm off to make the world better for Phil. Thanks."
