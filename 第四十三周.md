### [Code Reviews](https://97-things-every-x-should-know.gitbooks.io/97-things-every-programmer-should-know/content/en/thing_14/)
You should do code reviews. Why? Because they increase code quality and reduce defect rate. But not necessarily for the reasons you might think.(除了提高代码质量和降低缺陷率，你还要考虑其他的因素。)

Because they may previously have had some bad experiences with reviews, many programmers tend to dislike code reviews. I have seen organizations that require that all code pass a formal review before being deployed to production.（我见过一些组织，要求所有代码在部署到生产之前都必须经过正式审查） Often it is the architect or a lead developer doing this review, a practice that can be described as architect reviews everything. This is stated in their software development process manual, so therefore the programmers must comply.（通常是由架构师或首席开发人员进行此审查，这种实践可被描述为架构师对所有内容进行审查。这在他们的软件开发过程手册中有所说明，因此程序员必须遵守。） There may be some organizations that need such a rigid and formal process, but most do not. In most organizations such an approach is counterproductive.（可能有些组织需要这样一个僵化和正式的过程，但大多数组织不需要。在大多数组织中，这种方法适得其反） Reviewees can feel like they are being judged by a parole board. Reviewers need both the time to read the code and the time to keep up to date with all the details of the system. The reviewers can rapidly become the bottleneck in this process, and the process soon degenerates.（被审核者会觉得自己正在被假释委员会审判。审阅者既需要时间阅读代码，又需要时间来了解系统的所有详细信息。审阅者可以迅速成为此过程的瓶颈，并且该过程很快就会退化。）

Instead of simply correcting mistakes in code, the purpose of code reviews should be to share knowledge and establish common coding guidelines.（不仅仅是简单地纠正代码中的错误，代码审查的目的还应该是共享知识并建立通用的编码准则）Sharing your code with other programmers enables collective code ownership. Let a random team member walk through the code with the rest of the team. Instead of looking for errors you should review the code by trying to learn it and understand it.（与其查找错误，不如通过尝试学习和理解它来查看代码。）

Be gentle during code reviews. Ensure that comments are constructive, not caustic. （在代码审查期间要保持谦虚。确保评论具有建设性，而不是刻薄。）Introduce different review roles for the review meeting, to avoid having organizational seniority among team members affect the code review. （为审核会议引入不同的审核角色，以避免团队成员之间的组织资历影响代码审核。）Examples of roles could include having one reviewer focus on documentation, another on exceptions, and a third to look at the functionality. This approach helps to spread the review burden across the team members.（角色的示例可能包括让一位审阅者专注于文档，另一位审阅者关注异常，而第三位审阅者关注功能。这种方法有助于将审核负担分散到团队成员中。）

Have a regular code review day each week. Spend a couple of hours in a review meeting. Rotate the reviewee every meeting in a simple round-robin pattern. Remember to switch roles among team members every review meeting too. Involve newbies in code reviews.（让新手参与代码审查） They may be inexperienced, but their fresh university knowledge can provide a different perspective. （但他们的大学知识可以提供不同的见解）Involve experts for their experience and knowledge. They will identify error-prone code faster and with more accuracy. Code reviews will flow more easily if the team has coding conventions that are checked by tools. That way, code formatting will never be discussed during the code review meeting.（如果团队具有通过工具检查的编码约定，则代码审查将更容易进行。这样，在代码审查会议期间就永远不会讨论代码格式）

Making code reviews fun is perhaps the most important contributor to success.（使代码审查有趣可能是成功的最重要因素） Reviews are about the people reviewing. If the review meeting is painful or dull it will be hard to motivate anyone. Make it an informal code review whose prime purpose is sharing knowledge between team members. Leave sarcastic comments outside and bring a cake or brown bag lunch instead.（使其成为非正式的代码审查，其主要目的是在团队成员之间共享知识，将讽刺评论留在外面，改为带蛋糕或棕色袋子午餐）
