#### [How to Use a Bug Tracker](https://97-things-every-x-should-know.gitbooks.io/97-things-every-programmer-should-know/content/en/thing_38/)
Whether you call them bugs, defects, or even design side effects, there is no getting away from them. Knowing how to submit a good bug report and also what to look for in one are key skills for keeping a project moving along nicely.
A good bug report needs three things:

- How to reproduce the bug, as precisely as possible, and how often this will make the bug appear.
- What should have happened, at least in your opinion.
- What actually happened, or at least as much information as you have recorded.

The amount and quality of information reported in a bug says as much about the reporter as it does about the bug. Angry, terse bugs ("This function sucks!") tell the developers that you were having a bad time, but not much else. A bug with plenty of context to make it easier to reproduce earns the respect of everyone, even if it stops a release.

Bugs are like a conversation, with all the history right there in front of everyone. Don't blame others or deny the bug's very existence. Instead ask for more information or consider what you could have missed.

Changing the status of a bug, e.g., Open to Closed, is a public statement of what you think of the bug. Taking the time to explain why you think the bug should be closed will save tedious（乏味） hours later on justifying it to frustrated managers and customers. Changing the priority of a bug is a similar public statement, and just because it's trivial（不重要的） to you doesn't mean it isn't stopping someone else from using the product.

Don't overload a bug's fields for your own purposes. Adding "VITAL:" to a bug's subject field may make it easier for you to sort the results of some report, but it will eventually be copied by others and inevitably mistyped, or will need to be removed for use in some other report. Use a new value or a new field instead, and document how the field is supposed to be used so other people don't have to repeat themselves.

Make sure that everyone knows how to find the bugs that the team is supposed to be working on. This can usually be done using a public query with an obvious name. Make sure everyone is using the same query, and don't update this query without first informing the team that you're changing what everyone is working on.

Finally, remember that a bug is not a standard unit of work any more than a line of code is a precise measurement of effort.

summary    
如何写一个bug报告：
- 尽可能详细的描述bug如何复现的，并且描述bug发生的频率。
- 至少说一下 在你看来应该发生了什么。
- 实际发生了什么，或者至少与您所记录的信息一样多。

#### [Improve Code by Removing It](https://97-things-every-x-should-know.gitbooks.io/97-things-every-programmer-should-know/content/en/thing_39/)
Less is more. It's a quite trite little maxim, but sometimes it really is true.

One of the improvements I've made to our codebase over the last few weeks is to remove chunks of it.

We'd written the software following XP tenets, including YAGNI (that is, You Aren't Gonna Need It). Human nature being what it is, we inevitably fell short in a few places.

I observed that the product was taking too long to execute certain tasks — simple tasks that should have been near instantaneous（瞬间）. This was because they were overimplemented; festooned with extra bells and whistles that were not required, but at the time had seemed like a good idea.

So I've simplified the code, improved the product performance, and reduced the level of global code entropy simply by removing the offending features from the codebase. Helpfully（有益地）, my unit tests tell me that I haven't broken anything else during the operation.

A simple and thoroughly satisfying experience.（一个简单而完全令人满意的体验。）

So why did the unnecessary code end up there in the first place? Why did one programmer feel the need to write extra code, and how did it get past review or the pairing process? Almost certainly something like:

- It was a fun bit of extra stuff, and the programmer wanted to write it. (Hint: Write code because it adds value, not because it amuses（悦乐） you.)
- Someone thought that it might be needed in the future, so felt it was best to code it now. (Hint: That isn't YAGNI. If you don't need it right now, don't write it right now.)
- It didn't appear to be that big an "extra," so it was easier to implement it rather than go back to the customer to see whether it was really required. (Hint: It always takes longer to write and to maintain extra code. And the customer is actually quite approachable. A small extra bit of code snowballs over time into a large piece of work that needs maintenance.)
- The programmer invented extra requirements that were neither documented nor discussed that justified the extra feature. The requirement was actually bogus. (Hint: Programmers do not set system requirements; the customer does.)

What are you working on right now? Is it all needed?

重构代码最好的方法就是删除废弃代码。

#### [Install Me](https://97-things-every-x-should-know.gitbooks.io/97-things-every-programmer-should-know/content/en/thing_40/)
I am not the slightest(丝毫) bit interested in your program.

I am surrounded by problems and have a to-do list as long as my arm. The only reason I am at your website right now is because I have heard an unlikely rumor that every one my problems will be eliminated by your software. You'll forgive me if I'm skeptical.

If eyeball tracking studies are correct, I've already read the title and I'm scanning for blue underlined text marked download now. As an aside, if I arrived at this page with a Linux browser from a UK IP, chances are I would like the Linux version from a European mirror, so please don't ask. Assuming the file dialog opens straight away, I consign the thing to my download folder and carry on reading.

We all constantly perform cost-benefit analysis of everything we do. If your project drops below my threshold for even a second, I will ditch it and go onto something else. Instant gratification is best.

The first hurdle（栏） is install. Don't think that's much of a problem? Go to your download folder now and have a look around. Full of tar and zip files right? What percentage of those have you unpacked? How many have you installed? If you are like me, only a third are doing little more than acting as hard drive filler.

I may want doorstep convenience, but I don't want you entering my house uninvited. Before typing install I would like to know exactly where you are putting stuff. It's my computer and I like to keep it tidy when I can. I also want to be able to remove your program the instant I am disenchanted with it. If I suspect that's impossible I won't install it in the first place. My machine is stable right now and I want to keep it that way.

If your program is GUI based then I want to do something simple and see a result. Wizards（向导） don't help, because they do stuff that I don't understand. Chances are I want to read a file, or write one. I don't want to create projects, import directories, or tell you my email address. If all is working, on to the tutorial.

If your software is a library, then I carry on reading your web page looking for a quick start guide. I want the equivalent of "Hello world" in a five-line no-brainer with exactly the output described by your website. No big XML files or templates to fill out, just a single script. Remember, I have also downloaded your rival's framework. You know, the one who always claims to be so much better than yours in the forums? If all is working, onto the tutorial.

There is a tutorial isn't there? One that talks to me in language I can understand?

And if the tutorial mentions my problem, I'll cheer up. Now I'm reading about the things I can do it starts to get interesting, fun even. I'll lean back and sip my tea — did I mention I was from the UK? — and I'll play with your examples and learn to use your creation. If it solves my problem, I'll send you a thank-you email. I'll send you bug reports when it crashes, and suggestions for features too. I'll even tell all my friends how your software is the best, even though I never did try your rival's. And all because you took such care over my first tentative steps. How could I ever have doubted you?

#### 什么是好代码？
1. 简单，直接。
2. 依赖最少。
3. 考虑全面的，例如错误处理是一个明确的策略。
4. 性能最优的。
#### 好代码的标准排名  
1. 可读性。
- 逐字翻译。如果一个代码逐字翻译成中文，试着组成句子，之后把中文句子读给另一个人没有看过这段代码的人听，如果另一个人能听懂，那么这段代码的可读性基本就合格了。要理解某个词，那就需要联系上下文，理解一句代码在做什么需要联系的上下文越多，意味着代码质量越差。
- 遵循约定。约定包括代码和文档如何组织，注释如何编写，编码风格的约定等等，这对于代码未来的维护很重要。
- 文档和注释。 文档和注释是程序很重要的部分，他们是理解一个工程或项目的途径之一。
2. 考虑全面。
- 处理异常。
- 处理并发。
- 优化性能。优化性能可能会让可读性变差，复杂度提高，这时你需要注释说明 程序的瓶颈，如果优化，以及优化带来的效益。
- 日志。日志是为了更好更快的排查问题。日志需要足够，在异常，外部调用的时候需要日志。日志需要打印关键信息，比如 调用的上下文、外部的返回值，用于查询的关键字。
3. 可维护的代码。
- 避免重复。
- 模块划分。
- 简洁与抽象。
