## Review
#### [Deploy Early and Often](https://97-things-every-x-should-know.gitbooks.io/97-things-every-programmer-should-know/content/en/thing_20/)
Debugging the deployment and installation processes is often put off until close to the end of a project. In some projects writing installation tools is delegated to a release engineer who take on the task as a "necessary evil." Reviews and demonstrations are done from a hand-crafted environment to ensure that everything works. The result is that the team gets no experience with the deployment process or the deployed environment until it may be too late to make changes.

The installation/deployment process is the first thing that the customer sees, and a simple installation/deployment process is the first step to having a reliable (or, at least, easy to debug) production environment. The deployed software is what the customer will use. By not ensuring that the deployment sets up the application correctly, you'll raise questions with your customer before they get to use your software thoroughly.

Starting your project with an installation process will give you time to evolve the process as you move through the product development cycle, and the chance to make changes to the application code to make the installation easier. Running and testing the installation process on a clean environment periodically also provides a check that you have not made assumptions in the code that rely on the development or test environments.

Putting deployment last means that the deployment process may need to be more complicated to work around assumptions in the code. What seemed a great idea in an IDE, where you have full control over an environment, might make for a much more complicated deployment process. It is better to know all the trade-offs sooner rather than later.

While "being able to deploy" doesn't seem to have a lot of business value early on as compared to seeing an application run on a developer's laptop, the simple truth is that until you can demonstrate you application on the target environment, there is a lot of work to do before you can deliver business value. If your rationale for putting off a deployment process is that it is trivial, then do it anyway since it is low cost. If it's too complicated, or if there are too many uncertainties, do what you would do with application code: experiment, evaluate, and refactor the deployment process as you go.

The installation/deployment process is essential to the productivity of your customers or your professional services team, so you should be testing and refactoring this process as you go. We test and refactor the source code throughout a project. The deployment deserves no less.

#### [Distinguish Business Exceptions from Technical 区分业务异常和技术异常](https://97-things-every-x-should-know.gitbooks.io/97-things-every-programmer-should-know/content/en/thing_21/)
There are basically two reasons that things go wrong at runtime: technical problems that prevent us from using the application and business logic that prevents us from misusing the application. Most modern languages, such as LISP, Java, Smalltalk, and C#, use exceptions to signal both these situations. However, the two situations are so different that they should be carefully held apart. It is a potential source of confusion to represent them both using the same exception hierarchy, not to mention the same exception class.

An unresolvable technical problem can occur when there is a programming error. For example, if you try to access element 83 from an array of size 17, then the program is clearly off track, and some exception should result. The subtler version is calling some library code with inappropriate arguments, causing the same situation on the inside of the library.

It would be a mistake to attempt to resolve these situations you caused yourself. Instead we let the exception bubble up to the highest architectural level and let some general exception-handling mechanism do what it can to ensure the system is in a safe state, such as rolling back a transaction, logging and alerting administration, and reporting back (politely) to the user.(尝试解决您自己造成的这些情况是错误的。相反，我们让异常冒泡到最高的架构级别，并让一些常规的异常处理机制尽其所能来确保系统处于安全状态，例如回滚交易，记录日志和警报管理以及（礼貌地）向用户报告)

A variant of this situation is when you are in the "library situation" and a caller has broken the contract of your method, e.g., passing a totally bizarre argument or not having a dependent object set up properly. This is on a par with accessing 83rd element from 17: the caller should have checked; not doing so is a programmer error on the client side. The proper response is to throw a technical exception.

A different, but still technical, situation is when the program cannot proceed because of a problem in the execution environment, such as an unresponsive database. In this situation you must assume that the infrastructure did what it could to resolve the situation — repairing connections and retrying a reasonable number of times — and failed. Even if the cause is different, the situation for the calling code is similar: there is little it can do about it. So, we signal the situation through an exception that we let bubble up to the general exception handling mechanism.

In contrast to these, we have the situation where you cannot complete the call for a domain-logical reason. In this case we have encountered a situation that is an exception, i.e., unusual and undesirable, but not bizarre or programmatically in error. For example, if I try to withdraw money from an account with insufficient funds. In other words, this kind of situation is a part of the contract, and throwing an exception is just an alternative return path that is part of the model and that the client should be aware of and be prepared to handle. For these situations it is appropriate to create a specific exception or a separate exception hierarchy so that the client can handle the situation on its own terms.

Mixing technical exceptions and business exceptions in the same hierarchy blurs the distinction and confuses the caller about what the method contract is, what conditions it is required to ensure before calling, and what situations it is supposed to handle. Separating the cases gives clarity and increases the chances that technical exceptions will be handled by some application framework, while the business domain exceptions actually are considered and handled by the client code.
##### 如何处理业务异常？  
客户端代码考虑和处理。
##### 如何处理技术异常？  
不要自己处理，让异常交给框架。并通过一下机制来确保系统处理安全状态，比如事务回滚，记录日志，提醒管理人员，并有礼貌地向用户报告。

#### [Do Lots of Deliberate Practice 做很多的刻意练习](https://97-things-every-x-should-know.gitbooks.io/97-things-every-programmer-should-know/content/en/thing_22/)

Deliberate practice is not simply performing a task. If you ask yourself "Why am I performing this task?" and your answer is "To complete the task," then you're not doing deliberate practice.（刻意的练习不只是执行任务。如果您问自己“我为什么要执行此任务？”并且您的答案是“要完成任务”，那么您就没有进行刻意的练习。）

You do deliberate practice to improve your ability to perform a task. It's about skill and technique. Deliberate practice means repetition. （您会进行有计划的练习以提高执行任务的能力。这与技能和技巧有关。故意练习意味着重复。）It means performing the task with the aim of increasing your mastery of one or more aspects of the task.（这意味着执行任务的目的是增强您对任务的一个或多个方面的掌握。） It means repeating the repetition. Slowly, over and over again. Until you achieve your desired level of mastery. You do deliberate practice to master the task not to complete the task.

The principal aim of paid development is to finish a product whereas the principal aim of deliberate practice is to improve your performance. （付费开发的主要目的是完成产品，而有意识的实践的主要目的是改善您的性能。）They are not the same. Ask yourself, how much of your time do you spend developing someone else's product? How much developing yourself?（它们不一样。问问自己，您花费多少时间开发别人的产品？花了多少时间开发你自己的。）

How much deliberate practice does it take to acquire expertise?  （获得专业知识需要多少刻意的练习？）
- Peter Norvig writes that "It may be that 10,000 hours [...] is the magic number."  
- In Leading Lean Software Development Mary Poppendieck notes that "It takes elite performers a minimum of 10,000 hours of deliberate focused practice to become experts."  

The expertise arrives gradually over time — not all at once in the 10,000th hour! Nevertheless, 10,000 hours is a lot: about 20 hours per week for 10 years. Given this level of commitment you might be worrying that you're just not expert material. You are. Greatness is largely a matter of conscious choice. Your choice. Research over the last two decades has shown the main factor in acquiring expertise is time spent doing deliberate practice. Innate ability is not the main factor.

- Mary: "There is broad consensus among researchers of expert performance that inborn talent does not account for much more than a threshold; you have to have a minimum amount of natural ability to get started in a sport or profession. After that, the people who excel are the ones who work the hardest."

There is little point deliberately practicing something you are already an expert at. Deliberate practice means practicing something you are not good at.
- Peter: "The key [to developing expertise] is deliberative practice: not just doing it again and again, but challenging yourself with a task that is just beyond your current ability, trying it, analyzing your performance while and after doing it, and correcting any mistakes."  
- Mary: "Deliberate practice does not mean doing what you are good at; it means challenging yourself, doing what you are not good at. So it's not necessarily fun."  
Deliberate practice is about learning. About learning that changes you; learning that changes your behavior. Good luck.
（刻意的练习是关于学习。关于改变你的学习；学习会改变您的行为。）
