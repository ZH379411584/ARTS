### [Coding with Reason 用理性编程](https://97-things-every-x-should-know.gitbooks.io/97-things-every-programmer-should-know/content/en/thing_15/)
Trying to reason about software correctness by hand results in a formal proof that is longer than the code and is more likely to contain errors than the code. Automated tools are preferable, but not always possible. What follows describes a middle path: reasoning semi-formally about correctness.(尝试手动推断软件正确性会导致形式上的证明，该形式的证明比代码更长，并且比代码更容易包含错误。自动化工具是首选，但并非总是可行。接下来的内容描述了一条中间路径：半正确地对正确性进行推理)

The underlying approach is to divide all the code under consideration into short sections — from a single line, such as a function call, to blocks of less than ten lines — and arguing about their correctness. The arguments need only be strong enough to convince your devil's advocate peer programmer.(基本的方法是将考虑中的所有代码分成几小段-从单行（例如函数调用）到少于十行的块-并讨论其正确性。这些论点仅需足以说服魔鬼的拥护者同行程序员.)

A section should be chosen so that at each endpoint the state of the program (namely, the program counter and the values of all "living" objects) satisfies an easily described property, and that the functionality of that section (state transformation) is easy to describe as a single task — these will make reasoning simpler. Such endpoint properties generalize concepts like precondition and postcondition for functions, and invariant for loops and classes (with respect to their instances). Striving for sections to be as independent of one another as possible simplifies reasoning and is indispensable when these sections are to be modified.

Many of the coding practices that are well known (although perhaps less well followed) and considered 'good' make reasoning easier. Hence, just by intending to reason about your code, you already start thinking toward a better style and structure. Unsurprisingly, most of these practices can be checked by static code analyzers:

1. Avoid using goto statements, as they make remote sections highly interdependent.(避免使用goto语句，因为它们会使远程部分高度相互依赖)
2. Avoid using modifiable global variables, as they make all sections that use them dependent.(避免使用可修改的全局变量，因为它们会使使用它们的所有部分都依赖)
3. Each variable should have the smallest possible scope. For example, a local object can be declared right before its first usage.(每个变量应具有尽可能小的范围。例如，一个本地变量可以在首次使用本地对象之前声明它)
4. Make objects immutable whenever relevant.（在相关时使对象不变）
5. Make the code readable by using spacing, both horizontal and vertical. For example, aligning related structures and using an empty line to separate two sections.（通过使用水平和垂直间距来使代码可读。例如，对齐相关结构并使用空行分隔两个部分）
6. Make the code self-documenting by choosing descriptive (but relatively short) names for objects, types, functions, etc.（通过为对象，类型，函数等选择描述性（但相对简短）的名称来使代码自记录）
7. If you need a nested section, make it a function.（如果您需要一个嵌套部分，请使其成为函数）
8. Make your functions short and focused on a single task. The old 24-line limit still applies. Although screen size and resolution have changed, nothing has changed in human cognition since the 1960s.（使您的功能简短，并专注于单个任务。旧的24行限制仍然适用。尽管屏幕尺寸和分辨率发生了变化，但自1960年代以来，人类的认知并未发生变化）
9. Functions should have few parameters (four is a good upper bound). This does not restrict the data communicated to functions: Grouping related parameters into a single object benefits from object invariants and saves reasoning, such as their coherence and consistency.（函数应该具有很少的参数（四个是一个好的上限）.这并不限制将数据传递给函数：将相关参数分组到单个对象中受益于对象不变性，并节省了推理（例如，它们的连贯性和一致性）。）
10. More generally, each unit of code, from a block to a library, should have a narrow interface. Less communication reduces the reasoning required. This means that getters that return internal state are a liability — don't ask an object for information to work with. Instead, ask the object to do the work with the information it already has. In other words, encapsulation is all — and only — about narrow interfaces.(更一般而言，从块到库的每个代码单元都应具有狭窄的接口。较少的交流减少了所需的推理。这意味着返回内部状态的getters是一种责任，不要要求对象提供信息。相反，要求对象使用其已有的信息进行工作。换句话说，封装只是狭窄接口的全部（唯一）)
11. In order to preserve class invariants, usage of setters should be discouraged, as setters tend to allow invariants that govern an object's state to be broken.(为了保留类不变式，不建议使用setter，因为setter倾向于允许破坏控制对象状态的不变式。)

As well as reasoning about its correctness, arguing about your code gives you understanding of it. Communicate the insights you gain for everyone's benefit.
