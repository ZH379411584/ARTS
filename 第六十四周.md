## Review
[Prefer Domain-Specific Types to Primitive Types 首选域特定类型胜于原始类型 ](Prefer Domain-Specific Types to Primitive Types)
On 23rd September 1999 the $327.6 million Mars Climate Orbiter was lost while entering orbit around Mars due to a software error back on Earth. The error was later called the metric mix-up. The ground station software was working in pounds while the spacecraft expected newtons, leading the ground station to underestimate the power of the spacecraft's thrusters by a factor of 4.45.

This is one of many examples of software failures that could have been prevented if stronger and more domain-specific typing had been applied. It is also an example of the rationale(基本原理) behind many features in the Ada language, one of whose primary design goals was to implement embedded(嵌入) safety-critical software. Ada has strong typing with static checking for both primitive types and user-defined types:
```
type Velocity_In_Knots is new Float range 0.0 .. 500.00;

type Distance_In_Nautical_Miles is new Float range 0.0 .. 3000.00;

Velocity: Velocity_In_Knots;

Distance: Distance_In_Nautical_Miles;

Some_Number: Float;

Some_Number:= Distance + Velocity; -- Will be caught by the compiler as a type error.
```
Developers in less demanding domains might also benefit from applying more domain-specific typing, where they might otherwise continue to use the primitive data types offered by the language and its libraries, such as strings and floats. In Java, C++, Python, and other modern languages the abstract data type is known as class. Using classes such as Velocity_In_Knots and Distance_In_Nautical_Miles adds a lot of value with respect to code quality:

1. The code becomes more readable as it expresses concepts of a domain, not just Float or String.
2. The code becomes more testable as the code encapsulates（封装） behavior that is easily testable.
3. The code facilitates（促进） reuse（重用） across applications and systems.

The approach is equally valid for users of both statically and dynamically typed languages. The only difference is that developers using statically typed languages get some help from the compiler while those embracing dynamically typed languages are more likely to rely on their unit tests. The style of checking may be different, but the motivation and style of expression is not.

The moral is to start exploring domain-specific types for the purpose of developing quality software.

#### [Prevent Errors 避免错误](https://97-things-every-x-should-know.gitbooks.io/97-things-every-programmer-should-know/content/en/thing_66/)
Error messages are the most critical interactions between the user and the rest of the system. They happen when communication between the user and the system is near breaking point.

It is easy to think of an error as being caused by a wrong input from the user. But people make mistakes in predictable, systematic ways. So it is possible to 'debug' the communication between the user and the rest of the system just as you would between other system components.

For instance, say you want the user to enter a date within an allowed range. Rather than letting the user enter any date, it is better to offer a device such as a list or calendar showing only the allowed dates. This eliminates any chance of the user entering a date outside of the range.

Formatting errors are another common problem. For instance, if a user is presented with a Date text field and enters an unambiguous date such as "July 29, 2012" it is unreasonable to reject it simply because it is not in a preferred format (such as "DD/MM/YYYY"). It is worse still to reject "29 / 07 / 2012" because it contains extra spaces — this kind of problem is particularly hard for users to understand as the date appears to be in the desired format.

This error occurs because it is easier to reject the date than parse the three or four most common date formats. These kind of petty errors lead to user frustration, which in turn lead to additional errors as the user loses concentration. Instead, respect users' preference to enter information, not data.

Another way of avoiding formatting errors is to offer cues — for instance, with a label within the field showing the desired format ("DD/MM/YYYY"). Another cue might be to divide the field into three text boxes of two, two, and four characters.
Cues are different from instructions: Cues tend to be hints; instructions are verbose. Cues occur at the point of interaction; instructions appear before the point of interaction. Cues provide context; instructions dictate use.

In general, instructions are ineffective at preventing error. Users tend to assume that interfaces will work in line with their past experience ("Surely everyone knows what 'July 29, 2012' means?"). So instructions go unread. Cues nudge users away from errors.

Another way of avoiding errors is to offer defaults. For instance, users typically enter values that correspond to today, tomorrow, my birthday, my deadline, or the date I entered last time I used this form. Depending on context, one of these is likely to be a good choice as a smart default.

Whatever the cause, systems should be tolerant of errors. You can do this by providing multiple levels of undo to all actions — and in particular actions which have the potential to destroy or amend users' data.

Logging and analyzing undo actions can also highlight where the interface is drawing users into unconscious errors, such as persistently clicking on the 'wrong' button. These errors are often caused by misleading cues or interaction sequences that you can redesign to prevent further error.（记录和分析撤消操作还可以突出显示界面将用户吸引到无意识错误的位置，例如持续单击“错误”按钮。这些错误通常是由误导的提示或交互顺序引起的，可以重新设计以防止进一步的错误。）

Whichever approach you take, most errors are systematic — the result of misunderstandings between the user and the software. Understanding how users think, interpret information, make decisions, and input data will help you debug the interactions between your software and your users.

summary 

避免错误，你的数据需要用户输入时，系统需要限制用户输入时可选的范围，格式等等。你可以记录用户的操作来了解用户的交互习惯。

#### [The Professional Programmer](https://97-things-every-x-should-know.gitbooks.io/97-things-every-programmer-should-know/content/en/thing_67/)
What is a professional programmer?

The single most important trait（特征） of a professional programmer is personal responsibility. Professional programmers take responsibility for their career, their estimates（预估）, their schedule commitments（进度承诺）, their mistakes, and their workmanship. A professional programmer does not pass that responsibility off on others.

- If you are a professional, then you are responsible for your own career. You are responsible for reading and learning. You are responsible for staying up-to-date with the industry and the technology. Too many programmers feel that it is their employer's job to train them. Sorry, this is just dead wrong. Do you think doctors behave that way? Do you think lawyers behave that way? No, they train themselves on their own time, and their own nickel. They spend much of their off-hours reading journals and decisions. They keep themselves up-to-date. And so must we. The relationship between you and your employer is spelled out（阐明） nicely in your employment contract. In short: They promise to pay you, and you promise to do a good job.

- Professionals take responsibility for the code they write. They do not release code unless they know it works. Think about that for a minute. How can you possibly consider yourself a professional if you are willing to release code that you are not sure of? Professional programmers expect QA to find nothing because they don't release their code until they've thoroughly tested it. Of course QA will find some problems, because no one is perfect. But as professionals our attitude must be that we will leave nothing for QA to find.

- Professionals are team players. They take responsibility for the output of the whole team, not just their own work. They help each other, teach each other, learn from each other, and even cover for each other when necessary. When one team-mate falls down, the others step in, knowing that one day they'll be the ones to need cover.

- Professionals do not tolerate big bug lists. A huge bug list is sloppy. Systems with thousands of issues in the issue tracking database are tragedies of carelessness. Indeed, in most projects the very need for an issue tracking system is a symptom of carelessness. Only the very biggest systems should have bug lists so long that automation is required to manage them.

- Professionals do not make a mess. They take pride in their workmanship. They keep their code clean, well structured, and easy to read. They follow agreed upon standards and best practices. They never, ever rush. Imagine that you are having an out-of-body experience watching a doctor perform open-heart surgery on you. This doctor has a deadline (in the literal sense). He must finish before the heart-lung bypass machine damages too many of your blood cells. How do you want him to behave? Do you want him to behave like the typical software developer, rushing and making a mess? Do you want him to say: "I'll go back and fix this later?" Or do you want him to hold carefully to his disciplines, taking his time, confident that his approach is the best approach he can reasonably take. Do you want a mess, or professionalism?

Professionals are responsible. They take responsibility for their own careers. They take responsibility for making sure their code works properly. They take responsibility for the quality of their workmanship. They do not abandon their principles when deadlines loom. Indeed, when the pressure mounts, professionals hold ever tighter to the disciplines they know are right.

summary 

怎样才算一位专业的程序员，最重要的特征就是责任感特别强。专业程序员对他们的职业，预估，进度承诺，错误和做工负责。

上周去面试，面试官问我有没有在生产中处理过java内存溢出的问题，我回答不了，因为没有处理过。我只好讲一些理论方法，内存的分布，内存的回收。好吧，既然是名程序员，那就自己整个内存溢出再来分析一下吧。


模拟内存溢出的代码，jvm参数设置为 -Xms20M -Xmx20M -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError
```
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

/** *
 * @Date: 2019-06-12 22:58
 * 对内存溢出
 * -Xms20M -Xmx20M -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError
 **/
public class HeapOOM {
    static class OOMObject{

    }
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        a();
    }
    private static void a(){
        List<OOMObject> list = new ArrayList<>() ;
        while (true){
            list.add(new OOMObject());
        }
    }
}

```

### 分析啥？
分析dump文件。  
#### 如何生成dump文件。
1. 设置jvm启动参数 使jvm发生OOM时，自动生成dump文件。
```
-XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError  在jvm发生OOM发生时生成dump文件。
-XX:HeapDumpPath=/data/dump/dump.hprof  dump文件的路径
```
2. jmap命令
jmap -dump:live,format=b,file=heap.bin <pid>

<pid> 使用jps命令获得

### 如何分析？
#### 使用 JVisualVM
