In all but the smallest development project people work with people. In all but the most abstracted field of research people write software for people to support them in some goal of theirs. People write software with people for people. It's a people business. Unfortunately what is taught to programmers too often equips them very poorly to deal with people they work for and with. Luckily there is an entire field of study that can help.

For example, Ludwig Wittgenstein makes a very good case in the Philosophical(哲学) Investigations (and elsewhere) that any language we use to speak to one another is not, cannot be, a serialization format for getting a thought or idea or picture out of one person's head and into another's. Already we should be on our guard against misunderstanding when we "gather requirements." Wittgenstein also shows that our ability to understand one another at all does not arise from shared definitions, it arises from a shared experience, from a form of life. This may be one reason why programmers who are steeped in their problem domain tend to do better than those who stand apart from it.

Lakoff and Johnson present us with a catalog of Metaphors We Live By, suggesting that language is largely metaphorical, and that these metaphors offer an insight into how we understand the world. Even seemingly concrete terms like cash flow, which we might encounter in talking about a financial system, can be seen as metaphorical（隐喻的）: "money is a fluid." How does that metaphor influence the way we think about systems that handle money? Or we might talk about layers in a stack of protocols, with some high level and some low level. This is powerfully metaphorical: the user is "up" and the technology is "down." This exposes our thinking about the structure of the systems we build. It can also mark a lazy habit of thought that we might benefit from breaking from time to time.

Martin Heidegger studied closely the ways that people experience tools. Programmers build and use tools, we think about and create and modify and recreate tools. Tools are objects of interest to us. But for its users, as Heiddeger shows in Being and Time, a tool becomes an invisible（无形的） thing understood only in use. For users tools only become objects of interest when they don't work. This difference in emphasis is worth bearing in mind whenever usability is under discussion.

Eleanor Rosch overturned the Aristotelean model of the categories by which we organize our understanding of the world. When programmers ask users about their desires for a system we tend to ask for definitions built out of predicates. This is very convenient for us. The terms in the predicates can very easily become attributes on a class or columns in a table. These sorts of categories are crisp, disjoint, and tidy. Unfortunately, as Rosch showed in "Natural Categories" and later works, that just isn't how people in general understand the world. They understand it in ways that are based on examples. Some examples, so-called prototypes, are better than others and so the resulting categories are fuzzy（模糊）, they overlap（交叠）, they can have rich internal structure. In so far as we insist on Aristotelean answers we can't ask users the right questions about the user's world, and will struggle to come to the common understanding we need.


#### [Reinvent the Wheel Often](https://97-things-every-x-should-know.gitbooks.io/97-things-every-programmer-should-know/content/en/thing_72/)
"Just use something that exists — it's silly(愚蠢的) to reinvent the wheel..."

Have you ever heard this or some variation thereof? Sure you have! Every developer and student probably hears comments like this frequently. Why though? Why is reinventing the wheel so frowned upon（皱眉）? Because, more often than not, existing code is working code. It has already gone through some sort of quality control, rigorous（严格的） testing, and is being used successfully. Additionally, the time and effort invested in reinvention are unlikely to pay off as well as using an existing product or code base. Should you bother reinventing the wheel? Why? When?

Perhaps you have seen publications(书籍) about patterns in software development, or books on software design. These books can be sleepers regardless of how wonderful the information contained in them is. The same way watching a movie about sailing(航行) is very different to going sailing, so too is using existing code versus designing your own software from the ground up, testing it, breaking it, repairing it, and improving it along the way.

Reinventing the wheel is not just an exercise in where to place code constructs: It is how to get an intimate（亲密） knowledge of the inner workings of various components that already exist. Do you know how memory managers work? Virtual paging? Could you implement these yourself? How about double-linked lists? Dynamic array classes? ODBC clients? Could you write a graphical user interface that works like a popular one you know and like? Can you create your own web-browser widgets（小部件）? Do you know when to write a multiplexed（多路复用） system versus a multi-threaded one? How to decide between a file- or a memory-based database? Most developers simply have never created these types of core software implementations themselves and therefore do not have an intimate knowledge of how they work. The consequence is all these kinds of software are viewed as mysterious black boxes that just work. Understanding only the surface of the water is not enough to reveal（揭示） the hidden dangers beneath. Not knowing the deeper things in software development will limit your ability to create stellar work.

Reinventing the wheel and getting it wrong is more valuable than nailing it first time. There are lessons learned from trial and error that have an emotional component to them that reading a technical book alone just cannot deliver!

Learned facts and book smarts are crucial（关键）, but becoming a great programmer is as much about acquiring experience as it is about collecting facts. Reinventing the wheel is as important to a developer's education and skill as weight lifting（举重） is to a body builder.

#### [Resist the Temptation of the Singleton Pattern 抵制单例模式的诱惑](https://97-things-every-x-should-know.gitbooks.io/97-things-every-programmer-should-know/content/en/thing_73/)
The Singleton pattern solves many of your problems. You know that you only need a single instance. You have a guarantee that this instance is initialized before it's used. It keeps your design simple by having a global access point. It's all good. What's not to like about this classic design pattern?

Quite a lot, it turns out. Tempting they may be, but experience shows that most singletons really do more harm than good. They hinder testability and harm maintainability. Unfortunately, this additional wisdom is not as widespread as it should be and singletons continue to be irresistible(不可抗拒的) to many programmers. But it is worth resisting:

- The single-instance requirement is often imagined. In many cases it's pure speculation（推测） that no additional instances will be needed in the future. Broadcasting(传播) such speculative(推测) properties across an application's design is bound to cause pain at some point. Requirements will change. Good design embraces（拥抱） this. Singletons don't.

- Singletons cause implicit（隐含的） dependencies between conceptually independent units of code. This is problematic（有问题的） both because they are hidden and because they introduce unnecessary coupling between units. This code smell becomes pungent （泼辣）when you try to write unit tests, which depend on loose coupling and the ability to selectively substitute a mock implementation for a real one. Singletons prevent such straightforward mocking.

- Singletons also carry implicit（隐含的） persistent state, which again hinders（阻碍） unit testing. Unit testing depends on tests being independent of one another, so the tests can be run in any order and the program can be set to a known state before the execution of every unit test. Once you have introduced singletons with mutable（易变的） state, this may be hard to achieve. In addition, such globally accessible persistent state makes it harder to reason about the code, especially in a multi-threaded environment.

- Multi-threading introduces further pitfalls（陷阱） to the singleton pattern. As straightforward locking on access is not very efficient, the so-called double-checked locking pattern (DCLP) has gained in popularity. Unfortunately, this may be a further form of fatal（致命的） attraction. It turns out that in many languages DCLP is not thread-safe and, even where it is, there are still opportunities to get it subtly wrong.

The cleanup of singletons may present a final challenge:

- There is no support for explicitly（明确地） killing singletons, which can be a serious issue in some contexts. For example, in a plug-in architecture where a plug-in can only be safely unloaded after all its objects have been cleaned up.

- There is no order to the implicit cleanup of singletons at program exit. This can be troublesome for applications that contain singletons with interdependencies. When shutting down such applications, one singleton may access another that has already been destroyed.

- Some of these shortcomings can be overcome by introducing additional mechanisms. However, this comes at the cost of additional complexity in code that could have been avoided by choosing an alternative design.

Therefore, restrict your use of the Singleton pattern to the classes that truly must never be instantiated（实例化） more than once. Don't use a singleton's global access point from arbitrary code. Instead, direct access to the singleton should be from only a few well-defined places, from where it can be passed around via its interface to other code. This other code is unaware, and so does not depend on whether a singleton or any other kind of class implements the interface. This breaks the dependencies that prevented unit testing and improves the maintainability. So, next time you are thinking about implementing or accessing a singleton, hopefully you'll pause, and think again.
