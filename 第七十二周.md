## Review
#### [Use the Right Algorithm and Data Structure](https://97-things-every-x-should-know.gitbooks.io/97-things-every-programmer-should-know/content/en/thing_89/)
A big bank with many branch offices complained that the new computers it had bought for the tellers were too slow. This was in the time before everyone used electronic banking and ATMs were not as widespread as they are now. People would visit the bank far more often, and the slow computers were making the people queue up. Consequently, the bank threatened to break its contract with the vendor(供应商).

The vendor sent a performance analysis and tuning specialist to determine the cause of the delays. He soon found one specific program running on the terminal consuming almost all the CPU capacity. Using a profiling(剖析) tool, he zoomed in on the program and he could see the function that was the culprit(罪魁祸首
). The source code read:
```
for (i=0; i<strlen(s); ++i) {
  if (... s[i] ...) ...
}
```
And string s was, on average, thousands of characters long. The code (written by the bank) was quickly changed, and the bank tellers lived happily ever after....

Shouldn't the programmer have done better than to use code that needlessly scaled quadratically? Each call to strlen traversed every one of the many thousand characters in the string to find its terminating null character. The string, however, never changed. By determining its length in advance, the programmer could have saved thousands of calls to strlen (and millions of loop executions):

```
n=strlen(s);
for (i=0; i<n; ++i) {
  if (... s[i] ...) ...
}

```
Everyone knows the adage "first make it work, then make it work fast" to avoid the pitfall(陷阱) of micro-optimization. But the example above would almost make you believe that the programmer followed the Machiavellian adagio "first make it work slowly."

This thoughtlessness is something you may come across more than once. And it is not just a "don't reinvent the wheel" thing. Sometimes novice programmers just start typing away without really thinking and suddenly they have 'invented' bubble sort. They may even be bragging about吹牛) it.

The other side of choosing the right algorithm is
