### Redis Cluster 101
#### what do you get with Redis Cluster?
1. The ability to automatically split your dataset among multiple nodes.
2. The ability to continue operations when a subset of the nodes are experiencing failures or are unable to communicate with the rest of the cluster.
### Redis Cluster TCP ports
Note that for a Redis Cluster to work properly you need, for each node:
1. The normal client communication port (usually 6379) used to communicate with clients to be open to all the clients that need to reach the cluster, plus all the other cluster nodes (that use the client port for keys migrations).
2. The cluster bus port (the client port + 10000) must be reachable from all the other cluster nodes.
### Redis Cluster data sharding
Redis Cluster does not use consistent hashing, but a different form of sharding where every key is conceptually part of what we call an hash slot. 
There are 16384 hash slots in Redis Cluster, and to compute what is the hash slot of a given key, we simply take the CRC16 of the key modulo 16384. 
Every node in a Redis Cluster is responsible for a subset of the hash slots, so for example you may have a cluster with 3 nodes, where: 
- Node A contains hash slots from 0 to 5500.
- Node B contains hash slots from 5501 to 11000.
- Node C contains hash slots from 11001 to 16383.
Because moving hash slots from a node to another does not require to stop operations, adding and removing nodes, or changing the percentage of hash slots hold by nodes, does not require any downtime(停机).
### Redis Cluster master-slave model

### Redis Cluster consistency guarantees
Redis Cluster is not able to guarantee **strong consistency**. In practical terms this means that under certain conditions it is possible that Redis Cluster will lose writes that were acknowledged by the system to the client.

The first reason why Redis Cluster can lose writes is because it uses asynchronous replication. This means that during writes the following happens:

Your client writes to the master B.
The master B replies OK to your client.
The master B propagates the write to its slaves B1, B2 and B3.

As you can see B does not wait for an acknowledge from B1, B2, B3 before replying to the client, since this would be a prohibitive latency penalty for Redis, 
so if your client writes something, B acknowledges the write, but crashes before being able to send the write to its slaves, one of the slaves (that did not receive the write) can be promoted to master,
losing the write forever.

#### network partition

There is another notable scenario where Redis Cluster will lose writes, that happens during a network partition where a client is isolated with a minority of instances including at least a master.

Take as an example our 6 nodes cluster composed of A, B, C, A1, B1, C1, with 3 masters and 3 slaves. There is also a client, that we will call Z1.

After a partition occurs, it is possible that in one side of the partition we have A, C, A1, B1, C1, and in the other side we have B and Z1.

Z1 is still able to write to B, that will accept its writes. If the partition heals in a very short time, the cluster will continue normally.
However if the partition lasts enough time for B1 to be promoted to master in the majority side of the partition, the writes that Z1 is sending to B will be lost.

Note that there is a maximum window to the amount of writes Z1 will be able to send to B: if enough time has elapsed for the majority side of the partition to elect a slave as master, every master node in the minority side stops accepting writes.

This amount of time is a very important configuration directive of Redis Cluster, and is called the **node timeout**.

After node timeout has elapsed, a master node is considered to be failing, and can be replaced by one of its replicas. Similarly after node timeout has elapsed without a master node to be able to sense the majority of the other master nodes,
it enters an error state and stops accepting writes.

### Redis Cluster configuration parameters（redis配置）
- cluster-enabled <yes/no>: If yes enables Redis Cluster support in a specific Redis instance. Otherwise the instance starts as a stand alone instance as usual.
- cluster-config-file <filename>: Note that despite the name of this option, this is not an user editable configuration file, but the file where a Redis Cluster node automatically persists the cluster configuration (the state, basically) every time there is a change, in order to be able to re-read it at startup. 
The file lists things like the other nodes in the cluster, their state, persistent variables, and so forth. Often this file is rewritten and flushed on disk as a result of some message reception.
- cluster-node-timeout <milliseconds>: The maximum amount of time a Redis Cluster node can be unavailable, without it being considered as failing. 
If a master node is not reachable for more than the specified amount of time, it will be failed over by its slaves. 
This parameter controls other important things in Redis Cluster. Notably, every node that can't reach the majority of master nodes for the specified amount of time, will stop accepting queries.
- cluster-slave-validity-factor <factor>: If set to zero, a slave will always try to failover a master, regardless of the amount of time the link between the master and the slave remained disconnected.
If the value is positive, a maximum disconnection time is calculated as the node timeout value multiplied by the factor provided with this option, and if the node is a slave, it will not try to start a failover if the master link was disconnected for more than the specified amount of time. 
For example if the node timeout is set to 5 seconds, and the validity factor is set to 10, a slave disconnected from the master for more than 50 seconds will not try to failover its master. 
Note that any value different than zero may result in Redis Cluster to be unavailable after a master failure if there is no slave able to failover it. In that case the cluster will return back available only when the original master rejoins the cluster.
- cluster-migration-barrier <count>: Minimum number of slaves a master will remain connected with, for another slave to migrate to a master which is no longer covered by any slave. See the appropriate section about replica migration in this tutorial for more information.
- cluster-require-full-coverage <yes/no>: If this is set to yes, as it is by default, the cluster stops accepting writes if some percentage of the key space is not covered by any node. If the option is set to no, the cluster will still serve queries even if only requests about a subset of keys can be processed.
