#### [The Golden Rule of API Design](https://97-things-every-x-should-know.gitbooks.io/97-things-every-programmer-should-know/content/en/thing_35/)

API design is tough, particularly in the large. If you are designing an API that is going to have hundreds or thousands of users, you have to think about how you might change it in the future and whether your changes might break client code. Beyond that, you have to think about how users of your API affect you. If one of your API classes uses one of its own methods internally, you have to remember that a user could subclass your class and override it, and that could be disastrous(惨重). You wouldn't be able to change that method because some of your users have given it a different meaning. Your future internal implementation choices are at the mercy of your users.

API developers solve this problem in various ways, but the easiest way is to lock down（封锁） the API. If you are working in Java you might be tempted to make most of your classes and methods final. In C#, you might make your classes and methods sealed. Regardless of the language you are using, you might be tempted to present your API through a singleton or use static factory methods so that you can guard it from people who might override behavior and use your code in ways which may constrain your choices later. This all seems reasonable, but is it really?

Over the past decade, we've gradually realized that unit testing is an extremely important part of practice, but that lesson has not completely permeated the industry. The evidence is all around us. Take an arbitrary untested class that uses a third-party API and try to write unit tests for it. Most of the time, you'll run into trouble. You'll find that the code using the API is stuck to it like glue（胶水）. There's no way to impersonate（模拟） the API classes so that you can sense your code's interactions with them, or supply return values for testing.

Over time, this will get better, but only if we start to see testing as a real use case when we design APIs. Unfortunately, it's a little bit more involved than just testing our code. That's where the Golden Rule of API Design fits in: It's not enough to write tests for an API you develop; you have to write unit tests for code that uses your API. When you do, you learn first-hand the hurdles（障碍） that your users will have to overcome when they try to test their code independently.
There is no one way to make it easy for developers to test code which uses your API. static, final, and sealed are not inherently bad constructs. They can be useful at times. But it is important to be aware of the testing issue and, to do that, you have to experience it yourself. Once you have, you can approach it as you would any other design challenge.

##### summary
仅为您开发的API编写测试是不够的；您必须为使用您的API的代码编写单元测试。     
在日常开发中，基本没有单元测试与自动化测试。这个就是将来整个行业发展中需要提升的一个重点。
#### [The Guru Myth 大师的神话](https://97-things-every-x-should-know.gitbooks.io/97-things-every-programmer-should-know/content/en/thing_36/)
Anyone who has worked in software long enough has heard questions like this:
```
I'm getting exception XYZ. Do you know what the problem is?
```
Those asking the question rarely bother to include stack traces, error logs, or any context leading to the problem. They seem to think you operate on a different plane, that solutions appear to you without analysis based on evidence. They think you are a guru.

We expect such questions from those unfamiliar with software: To them systems can seem almost magical. What worries me is seeing this in the software community. Similar questions arise in program design, such as "I'm building inventory management（库存管理）. Should I use optimistic locking?" Ironically, people asking the question are often better equipped to answer it than the question's recipient. The questioners presumably know the context, know the requirements, and can read about the advantages and disadvantages of different strategies. Yet they expect you to give an intelligent answer without context. They expect magic.

It's time for the software industry to dispel this guru myth. "Gurus" are human. They apply logic and systematically analyze problems like the rest of us. They tap into mental shortcuts and intuition. Consider the best programmer you've ever met: At one point that person knew less about software than you do now. If someone seems like a guru, it's because of years dedicated（致力于）to learning and refining thought processes. A "guru" is simply a smart person with relentless（） curiosity.

Of course, there remains a huge variance in natural aptitude. Many hackers out there are smarter, more knowledgeable, and more productive than I may ever be. Even so, debunking the guru myth has a positive impact. For instance, when working with someone smarter than me I am sure to do the legwork, to provide enough context so that person can efficiently apply his or her skills. Removing the guru myth also means removing a perceived barrier to improvement. Instead of a magical barrier, I see a continuum on which I can advance.

Finally, one of software's biggest obstacles is smart people who purposefully propagate the guru myth. This might be done out of ego, or as a strategy to increase one's value as perceived by a client or employer. Ironically, this attitude can make smart people less valuable, since they don't contribute to the growth of their peers. We don't need gurus. We need experts willing to develop other experts in their field. There is room for all of us.

#### [Hard Work Does not Pay Off](https://97-things-every-x-should-know.gitbooks.io/97-things-every-programmer-should-know/content/en/thing_37/)

As a programmer, working hard often does not pay off. You might fool yourself and a few colleagues into believing that you are contributing a lot to a project by spending long hours at the office. But the truth is that by working less you might achieve more — sometimes much more. If you are trying to be focused and 'productive' for more than 30 hours a week you are probably working too hard. You should consider reducing the workload to become more effective and get more done.

This statement may seem counterintuitive(违反直觉) and even controversial(有争议), but it is a direct consequence of the fact that programming and software development as a whole involve a continuous learning process. As you work on a project you will understand more of the problem domain and, hopefully, find more effective ways of reaching the goal. To avoid wasted work, you must allow time to observe the effects of what you are doing, reflect over the things that you see, and change your behavior accordingly.

Professional programming is usually not like running hard for a few kilometers, where the goal can be seen at the end of a paved road. Most software projects are more like a long orienteering marathon(定向越野马拉松). In the dark. With only a sketchy map as guidance. If you just set off in one direction, running as fast as you can, you might impress some, but you are not likely to succeed. You need to keep a sustainable pace and you need to adjust the course when you learn more about where you are and where you are heading.

In addition, you always need to learn more about software development in general and programming techniques in particular. You probably need to read books, go to conferences(会议), communicate with other professionals, experiment with new implementation techniques, and learn about powerful tools that simplify your job. As a professional programmer you must keep yourself updated in your field of expertise — just as brain surgeons and pilots are expected to keep themselves up to date in their own fields of expertise. You need to spend evenings, weekends, and holidays educating yourself, therefore you cannot spend your evenings, weekends, and holidays working overtime on your current project. Do you really expect brain surgeons to perform surgery 60 hours a week, or pilots to fly 60 hours a week? Of course not, preparation and education is an essential part of their profession.

Be focused on the project, contribute as much as you can by finding smart solutions, improve your skills, reflect on what you are doing, and adapt your behavior. Avoid embarrassing yourself, and our profession, by behaving like a hamster in a cage spinning the wheel. As a professional programmer you should know that trying to be focused and 'productive' 60 hours a week is not a sensible thing to do. Act like a professional: prepare, effect, observe, reflect, and change.
#### summary
编程需要思考效率，你可以通过使用很多工具简化你的工作，准备和教育是职业的重要组成部分。像专家一样行事：做好准备，发挥作用，观察，反思和改变。
