### What is Continuous Integration?

Continuous integration (CI) is a process aimed at cutting out build cycle inefficiencies by allowing developers to compile the team’s code from a shared version control repository. CI also allows you to automate testing so you can set up the system to automatically run unit tests or integration tests for example.

### How does Continuous Integration/Delivery help a development team?
A lot of people talk about CI because it is considered a best practice to have all code verified automatically on every commit, regularly run tests, and continuously deploy--for the reasons mentioned above.

The process checks that the contributions from each developer work well together. Detecting these issues early makes it easier and faster to fix the bugs.

As you can probably guess, implementing CI/CD will cause a cultural shift in your team. You will have to become more agile and integrated.

CI was created to allow your team to stop wasting human time trying to manually resolve conflicting segments of new code, trigger builds, or run tests. Instead, it encourages adding small, incremental changes in code so you don’t end up with huge, complex bugs to fix. This speeds up the build cycle, potentially streamlining deployment and production.

And it’s helpful to remember--production is where your business actually makes money.

Also, interestingly, for a multi-developer remote team, CI is extremely helpful to implement because it brings you all together and continuously combines your work so you're all on the same page regardless of geographic location.


#### How CI helps the Bugfender team:
- Running Jenkins allows us to continuously check that the code compiles and run a set of basic tests that we have programmed to verify the base code after every commit.
- We automatically deploy the merged code to an integration environment, which can be used for manual tests (this bit is called “continuous delivery”).
- We also use it to generate and deploy production builds. Our deployments are complex because we are not updating a single machine: we’re updating a whole cluster of machines. We have to be sure to perform updates in a way that does not disrupt the service. Deployment on such an environment could be prone to errors if done by a human
