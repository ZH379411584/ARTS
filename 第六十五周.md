[Put Everything Under Version Control](https://97-things-every-x-should-know.gitbooks.io/97-things-every-programmer-should-know/content/en/thing_68/)

Put everything in all your projects under version control. The resources you need are there: free tools, like Subversion, Git, Mercurial, and CVS; plentiful disk space; cheap and powerful servers; ubiquitous（无处不在） networking; and even project-hosting services. After you've installed the version control software all you need in order to put your work in its repository is to issue the appropriate command in a clean directory containing your code. And there are just two new basic operations to learn: you commit your code changes to the repository and you update your working version of the project with the repository's version.

Once your project is under version control you can obviously track its history, see who wrote what code, and refer to a file or project version through a unique identifier. More importantly you can make bold code changes without fear — no more commented-out code just in case you need it in the future, because the old version lives safely in the repository. You can (and should) tag a software release with a symbolic name so that you can easily revisit in the future the exact version of the software your customer runs. You can create branches of parallel（并行） development: Most projects have an active development branch and one or more maintenance branches for released versions that are actively supported.

A version-control system minimizes friction（摩擦） between developers. When programmers work on independent software parts these get integrated almost by magic. When they step on each others' toes the system notices and allows them to sort out the conflicts. With some additional setup the system can notify all developers for each committed change, establishing a common understanding of the project's progress.

When you set up your project, don't be stingy（小气）: place all the project's assets under version control. Apart from the source code, include the documentation, tools, build scripts, test cases, artwork, and even libraries. With the complete project safely tucked into the (regularly backed up) repository the damage of losing your disk or data is minimized. Setting up for development on a new machine involves simply checking out the project from the repository. This simplifies distributing, building, and testing the code on different platforms: On each machine a single update command will ensure that the software is the current version.

Once you've seen the beauty of working with a version control system, following a couple of rules will make you and your team even more effective:

- Commit each logical change in a separate operation. Lumping many changes together in a single commit will make it difficult to disentangle them in the future. This is especially important when you make project-wide refactorings or style changes, which can easily obscure other modifications.
- Accompany each commit with an explanatory message. At a minimum describe succinctly（简洁的） what you've changed, but if you also want to record the change's rationale this is the best place to store it.
- Finally, avoid committing code that will break a project's build, otherwise you'll become unpopular with the project's other developers.

#### [Put the Mouse Down and Step Away from the Keyboard]()
You've been focused for hours on some gnarly problem and there's no solution in sight. So you get up to stretch your legs, or to hit the vending machines, and on the way back the answer suddenly becomes obvious.

Does this scenario sound familiar? Ever wonder why it happens? The trick is that while you're coding, the logical part of your brain is active and the creative side is shut out. It can't present anything to you until the logical side takes a break.

Here's a real-life example: I was cleaning up some legacy code and ran into an 'interesting' method. It was designed to verify that a string contained a valid time using the format hh:mm:ss xx, where hh represents the hour, mm represents minutes, ss represents seconds, and xx is either AM or PM.

The method used the following code to convert two characters (representing the hour) into a number, and verify it was within the proper range:
```
try {
Integer.parseInt(time.substring(0, 2));
} catch (Exception x) { return false;
}
if (Integer.parseInt(time.substring(0, 2)) > 12) { return false;
}
```
The same code appeared twice more, with appropriate changes to the character offset and upper limit, to test the minutes and seconds. The method ended with these lines to check for AM and PM:
``` 
if (!time.substring(9, 11).equals("AM") & !time.substring(9, 11).equals("PM")) { 

  return false;

}
```
If none of this series of comparisons failed, returning false, the method returned true.

If the preceding code seems wordy(啰嗦) and difficult to follow, don't worry. I thought so too — which meant I'd found something worth cleaning up. I refactored it and wrote a few unit tests, just to make sure it still worked.

When I finished, I felt pleased with the results. The new version was easy to read, half the size, and more accurate because the original code tested only the upper boundary for the hours, minutes, and seconds.

While getting ready for work the next day, an idea popped in my head: Why not validate the string using a regular expression? After a few minutes typing, I had a working implementation in just one line of code. Here it is:
```
 public static boolean validateTime(String time) {
return time.matches("(0[1-9]|1[0-2]):[0-5][0-9]:[0-5][0-9] ([AP]M)");
}
```
The point of this story is not that I eventually replaced over thirty lines of code with just one. The point is that until I got away from the computer, I thought my first attempt was the best solution to the problem.

So the next time you hit a nasty problem, do yourself a favor. Once you really understand the problem go do something involving the creative side of your brain — sketch out the problem, listen to some music, or just take a walk outside. Sometimes the best thing you can do to solve a problem is to put the mouse down and step away from the keyboard.

在一个棘手的问题上花了很多的时间，这时候你或许放下鼠标远离键盘，让自己休息一会。大脑休息一会，重新思考时思维或许会转变，可能方法就想出来了。

[Read Code](https://97-things-every-x-should-know.gitbooks.io/97-things-every-programmer-should-know/content/en/thing_70/)
We programmers are weird(奇怪的) creatures. We love writing code. But when it comes to reading it we usually shy away. After all, writing code is so much more fun, and reading code is hard — sometimes almost impossible. Reading other people's code is particularly hard. Not necessarily because other people's code is bad, but because they probably think and solve problems in a different way to you. But did you ever consider that reading someone else's code could improve your own?

The next time you read some code, stop and think for a moment. Is the code easy or hard to read? If it is hard to read, why is that? Is the formatting poor? Is naming inconsistent or illogical? Are several concerns mixed together in the same piece of code? Perhaps the choice of language prohibits the code from being readable? Try to learn from other people's mistakes, so that your code won't contain the same ones. You may receive a few surprises. For example, dependency-breaking techniques may be good for low coupling, but they can sometimes also make code harder to read. And what some people call elegant code, others call unreadable.

If the code is easy to read, stop to see if there is something useful you can learn from it. Maybe there's a design pattern in use that you don't know about, or had previously struggled to implement. Perhaps the methods are shorter and their names more expressive than yours. Some open source projects are full of good examples of how to write brilliant, readable code — while others serve as examples of the exact opposite! Check out some of their code and take a look.

Reading your own old code, from a project you are not currently working on, can also be an enlightening（启发的） experience. Start with some of your oldest code and work your way forward to the present. You will probably find that it is not at all as easy to read as when you wrote it. Your early code may also have a certain embarrassing entertainment value, kind of in the same way as being reminded of all the things you said when you were drinking in the pub last night. Look at how you have developed your skills over the years — it can be truly motivating（激励）. Observe what areas of the code are hard to read, and consider whether you are still writing code in the same way today.

So the next time you feel the need to improve your programming skills, don't read another book. Read code.

阅读代码，思考这个代码是容易阅读或者晦涩难懂。学习如何编写易读的代码，避免编码难懂的代码。

阅读自己以前的代码，你会获得一些额外的经验，回忆自己当时写代码的思路，如果现在开发，代码该如何写。
