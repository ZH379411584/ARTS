#### [Domain-Specific Languages 领域特定语言](https://97-things-every-x-should-know.gitbooks.io/97-things-every-programmer-should-know/content/en/thing_23/)
Whenever you listen to a discussion by experts in any domain, be it chess players, kindergarten teachers, or insurance agents, you'll notice that their vocabulary is quite different from everyday language. That's part of what domain-specific languages (DSLs) are about: A specific domain has a specialized vocabulary to describe the things that are particular to that domain.
In the world of software, DSLs are about executable expressions in a language specific to a domain with limited vocabulary and grammar that is readable, understandable, and — hopefully — writable by domain experts.（DSL是关于特定领域语言的可执行表达式，该领域具有有限的词汇和语法，可读性，可理解性以及（希望）由领域专家编写） DSLs targeted at software developers or scientists have been around for a long time. For example, the Unix 'little languages' found in configuration files and the languages created with the power of LISP macros are some of the older examples.
DSLs are commonly classified as either internal or external:（DSL通常分为内部或外部）

- Internal DSLs are written in a general purpose programming language whose syntax has been bent to look much more like natural language.（内部领域语言使用通用的编程语言编写，它看来起非常像自然语言） This is easier for languages that offer more syntactic sugar and formatting possibilities (e.g., Ruby and Scala) than it is for others that do not (e.g., Java).（对于提供更多语法糖和格式设置可能性的语言（例如Ruby和Scala），比不提供其他语法（例如Java）的语言更容易） Most internal DSLs wrap existing APIs, libraries, or business code and provide a wrapper for less mind-bending access to the functionality. They are directly executable by just running them. Depending on the implementation and the domain, they are used to build data structures, define dependencies, run processes or tasks, communicate with other systems, or validate user input. The syntax of an internal DSL is constrained by the host language. There are many patterns — e.g., expression builder, method chaining, and annotation — that can help you to bend the host language to your DSL. If the host language doesn't require recompilation, an internal DSL can be developed quite quickly working side by side with a domain expert.

- External DSLs are textual or graphical expressions of the language — although textual DSLs tend to be more common than graphical ones. （外部领域模型语言是语言的文字或图形表达，尽管文本DSL比图形DSL更普遍）Textual expressions can be processed by a tool chain that includes lexer, parser, model transformer, generators, and any other type of post-processing. External DSLs are mostly read into internal models which form the basis for further processing. It is helpful to define a grammar (e.g., in EBNF). A grammar provides the starting point for generating parts of the tool chain (e.g., editor, visualizer, parser generator). For simple DSLs, a handmade parser may be sufficient — using, for instance, regular expressions. Custom parsers can become unwieldy if too much is asked of them, so it makes sense to look at tools designed specifically for working with language grammars and DSLs — e.g., openArchitectureWare, ANTlr, SableCC, AndroMDA. Defining external DSLs as XML dialects is also quite common, although readability is often an issue — especially for non-technical readers.

You must always take the target audience of your DSL into account. Are they developers, managers, business customers, or end users? You have to adapt the technical level of the language, the available tools, syntax help (e.g., intellisense), early validation, visualization, and representation to the intended audience. By hiding technical details, DSLs can empower users by giving them the ability to adapt systems to their needs without requiring the help of developers. It can also speed up development because of the potential distribution of work after the initial language framework is in place. The language can be evolved gradually. There are also different migration paths for existing expressions and grammars available.

#### [Don't Be Afraid to Break Things](https://97-things-every-x-should-know.gitbooks.io/97-things-every-programmer-should-know/content/en/thing_24/)
Everyone with industry experience has undoubtedly worked on a project where the codebase was precarious(危险的) at best. The system is poorly factored（不良因素）, and changing one thing always manages to break another unrelated feature. Whenever a module is added, the coder's goal is to change as little as possible, and hold their breath（屏住呼吸） during every release. This is the software equivalent of playing Jenga with I-beams in a skyscraper, and is bound for disaster.

The reason that making changes is so nerve wracking（wracking） is because the system is sick. It needs a doctor, otherwise its condition will only worsen. You already know what is wrong with your system, but you are afraid of breaking the eggs to make your omelet. A skilled surgeon（外科医生） knows that cuts have to be made in order to operate, but the skilled surgeon also knows that the cuts are temporary and will heal. The end result of the operation is worth the initial pain, and the patient should heal to a better state than they were in before the surgery.

Don't be afraid of your code. Who cares if something gets temporarily broken while you move things around? A paralyzing（麻痹） fear of change is what got your project into this state to begin with. Investing the time to refactor will pay for itself several times over the life cycle of your project. An added benefit is that your team's experience dealing with the sick system makes you all experts in knowing how it should work. Apply this knowledge rather than resent（怨恨） it. Working on a system you hate is not how anybody should have to spend their time.

Redefine internal interfaces, restructure modules, refactor copy–pasted code, and simplify your design by reducing dependencies.（重新定义内部接口，重组模块，重构复制粘贴的代码，并通过减少依赖性来简化设计） You can significantly reduce code complexity by eliminating corner cases（消除极端情况，）, which often result from improperly coupled features.（通常是由于功能耦合不当造成的） Slowly transition the old structure into the new one, testing along the way. Trying to accomplish a large refactor in "one big shebang" will cause enough problems to make you consider abandoning the whole effort midway through.

Be the surgeon who isn't afraid to cut out the sick parts to make room for healing. The attitude is contagious（有感染性的） and will inspire others to start working on those cleanup projects they've been putting off. Keep a "hygiene"（卫生） list of tasks that the team feels are worthwhile for the general good of the project. Convince management that even though these tasks may not produce visible results, they will reduce expenses and expedite future releases. Never stop caring about the general "health" of the code.

#### [Don't Be Cute with Your Test Data 不要随意对待的你的测试数据](https://97-things-every-x-should-know.gitbooks.io/97-things-every-programmer-should-know/content/en/thing_25/)
```
It was getting late. I was throwing in some placeholder data to test the page layout I'd been working on.
I appropriated the members of The Clash for the names of users. Company names? Song titles by the Sex Pistols would do. Now I needed some stock ticker symbols — just some four letter words in capital letters.
I used those four letter words.
It seemed harmless. Just something to amuse myself, and maybe the other developers the next day before I wired up the real data source.
The following morning, a project manager took some screenshots for a presentation.*
```
Programming history is littered with these kinds of war stories. Things that developers and designers did "that no one else would see" which unexpectedly became visible. The leak type can vary but, when it happens, it can be deadly to the person, team, or company responsible. Examples include:
- During a status meeting, a client clicks on an button which is as yet unimplemented. They are told: "Don't click that again, you moron.(白痴)"
- A programmer maintaining a legacy system has been told to add an error dialog, and decides to use the output of existing behind-the-scenes logging to power it. Users are suddenly faced with messages such as "Holy database commit failure, Batman!" when something breaks.
- Someone mixes up the test and live administration interfaces, and does some "funny" data entry. Customers spot a $1m "Bill Gates-shaped personal massager" on sale in your online store.

To appropriate the old saying that "a lie can travel halfway around the world while the truth is putting on its shoes," in this day and age a screw-up can be Dugg, Twittered, and Flibflarbed before anyone in the developer's timezone is awake to do anything about it.

Even your source code isn't necessarily free of scrutiny. In 2004, when a tarball of the Windows 2000 source code made its way onto file sharing networks, some folks merrily grepped through it for profanity, insults, and other funny content. (The comment // TERRIBLE HORRIBLE NO GOOD VERY BAD HACK has, I will admit, become appropriated by me from time to time since!)

In summary, when writing any text in your code — whether comments, logging, dialogs, or test data — always ask yourself how it will look if it becomes public. It will save some red faces all round.
