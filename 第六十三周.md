## Review
#### [Only the Code Tells the Truth](https://97-things-every-x-should-know.gitbooks.io/97-things-every-programmer-should-know/content/en/thing_62/)

The ultimate semantics of a program is given by the running code. If this is in binary form only, it will be a difficult read! The source code should, however, be available if it is your program, any typical commercial software development, an open source project, or code in a dynamically interpreted language. Looking at the source code, the meaning of the program should be apparent. To know what a program does, the source is ultimately all you can be sure of looking at. Even the most accurate requirements document does not tell the whole truth: It does not contain the detailed story of what the program is actually doing, only the high-level intentions(意图) of the requirements analyst. A design document may capture a planned design, but it will lack the necessary detail of the implementation. These documents may be lost sync with the current implementation... or may simply have been lost. Or never written in the first place. The source code may be the only thing left.

With this in mind, ask yourself how clearly is your code telling you or any other programmer what it is doing?

You might say, "Oh, my comments will tell you everything you need to know." But keep in mind that comments are not running code. They can be just as wrong as other forms of documentation. There has been a tradition saying comments are unconditionally（无条件） a good thing, so unquestioningly some programmers write more and more comments, even restating and explaining trivia already obvious in the code. This is the wrong way to clarify your code. If your code needs comments, consider refactoring it so it doesn't. Lengthy（冗长的） comments can clutter（混乱） screen space and might even be hidden automatically by your IDE. If you need to explain a change, do so in the version control system check-in message and not in the code.

What can you do to actually make your code tell the truth as clearly as possible? Strive for good names. Structure your code with respect to cohesive（内聚的） functionality, which also eases naming. Decouple your code to achieve orthogonality. Write automated tests explaining the intended behavior and check the interfaces. Refactor mercilessly（无情地） when you learn how to code a simpler, better solution. Make your code as simple as possible to read and understand.

Treat your code like any other composition, such as a poem, an essay, a public blog, or an important email. Craft what you express carefully, so that it does what it should and communicates as directly as possible what it is doing, so that it still communicates your intention when you are no longer around. Remember that useful code is used much longer than ever intended. Maintenance programmers will thank you. And, if you are a maintenance programmer and the code you are working on does not tell the truth easily, apply the guidelines above in a proactive manner（积极的态度）. Establish some sanity（理智） in the code and keep your own sanity（理智）.

summary

你的代码可以让其他人清晰的了解它的作用吗？  
注释也不错，但是很多时间随着代码重构，注释却没修改，这样的注释变成了鸡肋。代码过长了，你应该考虑重构，而不是多加几行注释。  

#### [Own (and Refactor) the Build](https://97-things-every-x-should-know.gitbooks.io/97-things-every-programmer-should-know/content/en/thing_63/)
It is not uncommon for teams that are otherwise highly disciplined about coding practices to neglect build scripts, either out of a belief that they are merely an unimportant detail or from a fear that they are complex and need to be tended(趋向,) to by the cult of release engineering. Unmaintainable build scripts with duplication and errors cause problems of the same magnitude as those in poorly factored code.

One rationale（理由） for why disciplined, skilled developers treat the build as something secondary to their work is that build scripts are often written in a different language than source code. Another is that the build is not really "code." These justifications fly in the face of the reality that most software developers enjoy learning new languages and that the build is what creates executable artifacts for developers and end users to test and run. The code is useless without being built, and the build is what defines the component architecture of the application. The build is an essential part of the development process, and decisions about the build process can make the code and the coding simpler.

Build scripts written using the wrong idioms are difficult to maintain and, more significantly, improve. It is worth spending some time to understand the right way to make a change. Bugs can appear when an application is built with the wrong version of a dependency or when a build-time configuration is wrong.

Traditionally testing has been something that was always left to the "Quality Assurance" team. We now realize that testing as we code is necessary to being able to deliver value predictably（预测地交付价值）. In much the same way, the build process needs to be owned by the development team.

Understanding the build can simplify the entire development lifecycle and reduce costs. A simple-to-execute build allows a new developer to get started quickly and easily. Automating configuration in the build can enable you to get consistent results when multiple people are working on a project, avoiding an "it works for me" conversation. Many build tools allow you to run reports on code quality, letting you to sense potential problems early. By spending time understanding how to make the build yours, you can help yourself and everyone else on your team. You can focus on coding features, benefiting your stakeholders（利益相关者） and making work more enjoyable.

Learn enough of your build process to know when and how to make changes. Build scripts are code. They are too important to be left to someone else, if for no other reason than because the application is not complete until it is built. The job of programming is not complete until we have delivered working software.

summary

构建是开发的一个必不可少的流程，如何构建也会影响编码。构建很重要。


#### [Pair Program and Feel the Flow](https://97-things-every-x-should-know.gitbooks.io/97-things-every-programmer-should-know/content/en/thing_64/)

Imagine that you are totally absorbed by what you are doing — focused, dedicated, and involved. You may have lost track of time. You probably feel happy. You are experiencing flow. It is difficult to both achieve and maintain flow for a whole team of developers since there are so many interruptions, interactions, and other distractions that can easily break it.

If you have already practiced pair programming, you are probably familiar with how pairing contributes to flow. If you have not, we want to use our experiences to motivate you to start right now! To succeed with pair programming both individual team members and the team as a whole have to put in some effort.

As a team member, be patient with developers less experienced than you. Confront your fears about being intimidated（威吓） by more skilled developers. Realize that people are different, and value it. Be aware of your own strengths and weaknesses, as well as those of other team members. You may be surprised how much you can learn from your colleagues.

As a team, introduce pair programming to promote distribution（分配） of skills and knowledge throughout the project. You should solve your tasks in pairs and rotate pairs and tasks frequently. Agree upon a rule of rotation. Put the rule aside or adjust it when necessary. Our experience is that you do not necessarily need to complete a task before rotating it to another pair. Interrupting a task to pass it to another pair may sound counterintuitive（违反直觉的）, but we have found that it works.

There are numerous situations where flow can be broken, but where pair programming helps you keep it:

- Reduce the "truck factor 卡车因素": It's a slightly morbid（病态） thought experiment, but how many of your team members would have to be hit by a truck before the team became unable to complete the final deliverable? In other words, how dependent is your delivery on certain team members? Is knowledge privileged or shared? If you have been rotating tasks among pairs, there is always someone else who has the knowledge and can complete the work. Your team's flow is not as affected by the "truck factor."

- Solve problems effectively: If you are pair programming and you run into a challenging problem, you always have someone to discuss it with. Such dialog is more likely to open up possibilities than if you are stuck（卡住） by yourself. As the work rotates, your solution will be revisited and reconsidered by the next pair, so it does not matter if you did not choose the optimal solution initially.

- Integrate smoothly（顺利整合）: If your current task involves calling another piece of code, you hope the names of the methods, the docs, and the tests are descriptive（描述性的） enough to give you a grasp of what it does. If not, pairing with a developer who was involved in writing that code will give you better overview and faster integration into your own code. Additionally, you can use the discussion as an opportunity to improve the naming, docs, and testing.

- Mitigate interruptions（缓解干扰）: If someone comes over to ask you a question, or your phone rings, or you have to answer an urgent email, or you have to attend a meeting, your pair programming partner can keep on coding. When you return your partner is still in the flow and you will quickly catch up and rejoin them.

- Bring new team members up to speed quickly: With pair programming, and a suitable rotation of pairs and tasks, newcomers quickly get to know both the code and the other team members.

Flow makes you incredibly productive. But it is also vulnerable（脆弱的）. Do what you can to get it, and hold on to it when you've got it!
