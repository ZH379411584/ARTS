### [Comment Only What the Code Cannot Say 只有在代码不能表达时才注释](https://97-things-every-x-should-know.gitbooks.io/97-things-every-programmer-should-know/content/en/thing_17/)
The difference between theory and practice is greater in practice than it is in theory — an observation that certainly applies to comments. In theory, the general idea of commenting code sounds like a worthy one: Offer the reader detail, an explanation of what's going on. What could be more helpful than being helpful?(理论上，注释代码的一半想法听起来像是值得的，向读者提供详细信息，解释正在发生的事情，有什么比有帮助更有用) In practice, however, comments often become a blight. As with any other form of writing, there is a skill to writing good comments. Much of the skill is in knowing when not to write them.（在实践中，评论经常被写的毫无价值，这里有一些关于如何写好注释的技巧，更多的是要知道何时不写注释）

When code is ill-formed, compilers, interpreters, and other tools will be sure to object. If the code is in some way functionally incorrect, reviews, static analysis, tests, and day-to-day use in a production environment will flush most bugs out. （当代码格式错误时，编译器，解释器和其他工具会确保发现这个问题。如果代码在某些方面功能错误，reviews, static analysis, tests, 生产环境天天的使用将会过滤大部分bugs。）But what about comments? In The Elements of Programming Style Kernighan and Plauger noted that "a comment is of zero (or negative) value if it is wrong."（如果注释错误了，它的价值会为0或者负。） And yet such comments often litter and survive in a code base in a way that coding errors never could. They provide a constant source of distraction and misinformation, a subtle but constant drag on a programmer's thinking.（它们提供了源源不断的干扰和错误信息，这是对程序员思维的微妙但持续的拖累。）

What of comments that are not technically wrong, but add no value to the code?（在技术上没有错，但没有给代码增加价值的注释是怎么样的。） Such comments are noise. Comments that parrot the code offer nothing extra to the reader — stating something once in code and again in natural language does not make it any truer or more real. Commented-out code is not executable code, so it has no useful effect for either reader or runtime. It also becomes stale（陈旧） very quickly. Version-related comments and commented-out code try to address questions of versioning and history. These questions have already been answered (far more effectively) by version control tools.

A prevalence of noisy comments and incorrect comments in a code base encourage programmers to ignore all comments, either by skipping past them or by taking active measures to hide them. Programmers are resourceful and will route around anything perceived to be damage:（程序员很聪明，他们会绕过那些他们认为错误的事情。） folding comments up; switching coloring scheme so that comments and the background are the same color; scripting to filter out comments. To save a code base from such misapplications of programmer ingenuity, and to reduce the risk of overlooking any comments of genuine value, comments should be treated as if they were code. Each comment should add some value for the reader, otherwise it is waste that should be removed or rewritten.

What then qualifies as value? Comments should say something code does not and cannot say.（注释应该说一些代码不能也不能表达的东西） A comment explaining what a piece of code should already say is an invitation to change code structure or coding conventions so the code speaks for itself. Instead of compensating for poor method or class names, rename them. Instead of commenting sections in long functions, extract smaller functions whose names capture the former sections' intent. （不用注释长函数中的节，而提取较小的函数，这些函数的名称可以捕获前节的意图。）Try to express as much as possible through code. （尝试通过代码尽可能多地表达）Any shortfall between what you can express in code and what you would like to express in total becomes a plausible candidate for a useful comment. （代码不能表的东西和你想总结的东西可以成为有用的注释。）Comment what the code cannot say, not simply what it does not say.

注释在代码编译，运行期间不会报错，所以注释错误了很难去发现，并且一直遗留在代码中，导致程序难以维护。那么该怎么写注释？什么时候写注释？

注释应该解释代码不能表达的事情。要尽可能通过代码尽地表达，这样就可以大大减少注释量。




### [Continuous Learning 持续学习](https://97-things-every-x-should-know.gitbooks.io/97-things-every-programmer-should-know/content/en/thing_18/)
We live in interesting times. As development gets distributed across the globe, you learn there are lots of people capable of doing your job. You need to keep learning to stay marketable. Otherwise, you'll become a dinosaur, stuck in the same job until, one day, you'll no longer be needed or your job gets outsourced to some cheaper resource.

So what do you do about it? Some employers are generous enough to provide training to broaden your skill set. Others may not be able to spare the time or money for any training at all. To play it safe, you need to take responsibility for your own education.

Here's a list of ways to keep you learning. Many of these can be found on the Internet for free:

- Read books, magazines, blogs, twitter feeds, and web sites. If you want to go deeper into a subject, consider joining a mailing list or newsgroup.
- If you really want to get immersed in a technology（沉迷于技术）, get hands on — write some code.
- Always try to work with a mentor（导师）, as being the top guy can hinder your education. Although you can learn something from anybody, you can learn a whole lot more from someone smarter or more experienced than you. If you can't find a mentor, consider moving on.
- Use virtual mentors. Find authors and developers on the web who you really like and read everything they write. Subscribe to their blogs.
- Get to know the frameworks and libraries you use. Knowing how something works makes you know how to use it better. If they're open source, you're really in luck. Use the debugger to step through the code to see what's going on under the hood. You'll get to see code written and reviewed by some really smart people.

- Whenever you make a mistake, fix a bug, or run into a problem, try to really understand what happened. It's likely that somebody else ran into the same problem and posted it somewhere on the web. Google is really useful here.

- A really good way to learn something is to teach or speak about it. When people are going to listen to you and ask you questions, you'll be highly motivated to learn. Try a lunch-n-learn at work, a user group, or a local conference.

- Join or start a study group (à la patterns community) or a local user group for a language, technology, or discipline you are interested in.
- Go to conferences. And if you can't go, many conferences put their talks online for free.
Long commute? Listen to podcasts.

- Ever run a static analysis tool over the code base or look at the warnings in your IDE? Understand what they're reporting and why.

- Follow the advice of The Pragmatic Programmers and learn a new language every year. At least learn a new technology or tool. Branching out gives you new ideas you can use in your current technology stack.

- Not everything you learn has to be about technology. Learn the domain you're working in so you can better understand the requirements and help solve the business problem. Learning how to be more productive — how to work better — is another good option.

- Go back to school.

It would be nice to have the capability that Neo had in The Matrix, and simply download the information we needed into our brains. But we don't, so it will take a time commitment. You don't have to spend every waking hour learning. A little time, say each week, is better than nothing. There is (or should be) a life outside of work.
Technology changes fast. Don't get left behind.

### [Convenience Is not an -ility 便利不是灵活性](https://97-things-every-x-should-know.gitbooks.io/97-things-every-programmer-should-know/content/en/thing_19/)

Much has been said about the importance and challenges of designing good API's. It's difficult to get right the first time and it's even more difficult to change later. Sort of like raising children. Most experienced programmers have learned that a good API follows a consistent level of abstraction, exhibits consistency and symmetry, and forms the vocabulary for an expressive language. Alas, being aware of the guiding principles does not automatically translate into appropriate behavior. Eating sweets is bad for you.

Instead of preaching from on high, I want to pick on a particular API design 'strategy,' one that I encounter time and again: the argument of convenience.It typically begins with one of the following 'insights:'（便利性这一论点，它通常从以下“见解”之一开始） 
- I don't want other classes to have to make two separate calls to do this one thing.（我不希望其他类必须进行两个单独的调用来完成此操作）
- Why should I make another method if it's almost the same as this method? I'll just add a simple switch.（如果该方法与我的方法几乎相同，为什么还要我做另一种方法？我将添加一个简单的开关。）
- See, it's very easy: If the second string parameter ends with ".txt", the method automatically assumes that the first parameter is a file name, so I really don't need two methods.（瞧，这很简单：如果第二个字符串参数以“ .txt”结尾，则该方法会自动假定第一个参数是文件名，因此我真的不需要两个方法）

While well intended, such arguments are prone to decrease the readability of code using the API. A method invocation like
```
parser.processNodes(text, false);
```
is virtually meaningless without knowing the implementation or at least consulting the documentation.（在不了解实现或至少查阅文档的情况下几乎没有任何意义） This method was likely designed for the convenience of the implementer as opposed to the convenience of the caller （此方法可能是为实现者的方便而设计的，而不是为调用者的方便而设计的）— "I don't want the caller to have to make two separate calls" translated into "I didn't want to code up two separate methods." There's nothing fundamentally wrong with convenience if it's intended to be the antidote to tediousness, clunkiness, or awkwardness.（如果它旨在解决乏味，笨拙或尴尬的问题，那么便利性从根本上没有错） However, if we think a bit more carefully about it, the antidote to those symptoms is efficiency, consistency, and elegance, not necessarily convenience.（但是，如果我们仔细考虑一下，解决这些症状的办法就是提高效率，保持一致性和优雅，而不一定是方便。） APIs are supposed to hide underlying complexity, so we can realistically expect good API design to require some effort. （API应该隐藏潜在的复杂性，因此我们可以现实地期望良好的API设计需要付出一些努力。）A single large method could certainly be more convenient to write than a well thought-out set of operations, but would it be easier to use?（一个大型方法肯定比经过深思熟虑的操作集更方便编写，但使用起来会更容易吗？）

The metaphor of API as a language can guide us towards better design decisions in these situations. An API should provide an expressive language, which gives the next layer above sufficient vocabulary to ask and answer useful questions.（API作为一种语言的隐喻可以指导我们在这些情况下做出更好的设计决策。 API应该提供一种表达性语言，该语言可以为上一层提供足够的词汇表，以询问和回答有用的问题。） This does not imply it should provide exactly one method, or verb, for each question that may be worth asking. A diverse vocabulary allows us to express subtleties in meaning. For example, we prefer to say run instead of walk(true), even though it could be viewed as essentially the same operation, just executed at different speeds. A consistent and well thought out API vocabulary makes for expressive and easy to understand code in the next layer up. More importantly, a composable vocabulary allows other programmers to use the API in ways you may not have anticipated — a great convenience indeed for the users of the API! （更重要的是，可组合的词汇表允许其他程序员以您未曾预料到的方式使用API-对于API用户而言，这确实是一个极大的便利）Next time you are tempted to lump a few things together into one API method, remember that the English language does not have one word for MakeUpYourRoomBeQuietAndDoYourHomeWork , even though it would seem really convenient for such a frequently requested operation.（下次您很想将一些东西放到一个API方法中时，请记住英语对于MakeUpYourRoomBeQuietAndDoYourHomeWork没有一个词。即使对于这样经常请求的操作来说似乎很方便。）

便利等同不了灵活性。  

一个大型方法肯定比经过深思熟虑的操作集更方便编写，但使用起来会更容易吗？编写者应该从调用者的方面考虑，而不是自己的实现方便。将所有的步骤操作都放在一个方法里，的确方便编写，但是带来的问题是不容易修改，不容易理解。应该将这个长方法拆分成一系列的子方法，这样调用者更容易理解，也更容易修改，扩展。
