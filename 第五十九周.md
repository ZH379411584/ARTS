#### [Learn to Estimate 学会评估](https://97-things-every-x-should-know.gitbooks.io/97-things-every-programmer-should-know/content/en/thing_50/)
As a programmer you need to be able to provide estimates to your managers, colleagues, and users for the tasks you need to perform, so that they will have a reasonably(合理地) accurate idea of the time, costs, technology, and other resources needed to achieve their goals.

To be able to estimate well it is obviously important to learn some estimation techniques. First of all, however, it is fundamental to learn what estimates are, and what they should be used for — as strange as it may seem, many developers and managers don't really know this.

The following exchange between a project manager and a programmer is not untypical(并非不常见):

```
Project Manager: Can you give me an estimate of the time necessary to develop feature xyz?
Programmer: One month.
Project Manager: That's far too long! We've only got one week.
Programmer: I need at least three.
Project Manager: I can give you two at most.
Programmer: Deal!
```
The programmer, at the end, comes up with an "estimate" that matches what is acceptable for the manager. But since it is seen to be the programmer's estimate, the manager will hold the programmer accountable（负责） to it. To understand what is wrong with this conversation we need three definitions — estimate, target, and commitment（承诺）:

- An estimate is an approximate calculation or judgement of the value, number, quantity, or extent of something. This definition implies that an estimate is a factual measure（事实的措施） based on hard data and previous experience — hopes and wishes must be ignored when calculating it. The definition also implies that, being approximate, an estimate cannot be precise, e.g., a development task cannot be estimated to last 234.14 days.

- A target is a statement of a desirable（理想的） business objective, e.g., "The system must support at least 400 concurrent users."
- A commitment is a promise to deliver specified functionality at a certain level of quality by a certain date or event. One example could be "The search functionality will be available in the next release of the product."

Estimates, targets, and commitments are independent from each other, but targets and commitments should be based on sound（合理的） estimates. As Steve McConnell notes, "The primary purpose of software estimation is not to predict a project's outcome; it is to determine whether a project's targets are realistic enough to allow the project to be controlled to meet them." Thus, the purpose of estimation is to make proper project management and planning possible, allowing the project stakeholders to make commitments based on realistic targets.

What the manager in the conversation above was really asking the programmer was to make a commitment based on an unstated target that the manager had in mind, not to provide an estimate. The next time you are asked to provide an estimate make sure everybody involved knows what they are talking about, and your projects will have a better chance of succeeding. Now it's time to learn some techniques....

软件评估的主要目的不是预测项目的结果。它是要确定项目的目标是否足够现实，以使该项目得以控制以实现目标。

#### [Learn to Say "Hello, World"](https://97-things-every-x-should-know.gitbooks.io/97-things-every-programmer-should-know/content/en/thing_51/)
Paul Lee, username leep, more commonly known as Hoppy, had a reputation as the local expert on programming issues. I needed help. I walked across to Hoppy's desk and asked, could he take a look at some code for me?

Sure, said Hoppy, pull up a chair. I took care not to topple the empty cola cans stacked in a pyramid behind him.

What code?

In a function in a file, I said.

So let's take a look at this function. Hoppy moved aside a copy of K&R and slid his keyboard in front of me.

Where's the IDE? Apparently Hoppy had no IDE running, just some editor which I couldn't operate. He grabbed back the keyboard. A few keystrokes later and we had the file open — it was quite a big file — and were looking at the function — it was quite a big function. He paged down to the conditional block I wanted to ask about.

What would this clause actually do if x is negative? I asked. Surely it's wrong.

I'd been trying all morning to find a way to force x to be negative, but the big function in the big file was part of a big project, and the cycle of recompiling then rerunning my experiments was wearing me down. Couldn't an expert like Hoppy just tell me the answer?

Hoppy admitted he wasn't sure. To my surprise, he didn't reach for K&R. Instead, he copied the code block into a new editor buffer, re-indented it, wrapped it up in a function. A short while later he'd coded up a main function that looped forever, prompting the user for input values, passing them to the function, printing out the result. He saved the buffer as a new file, tryit.c. All of this I could have done for myself, though perhaps not as quickly. But his next step was wonderfully simple and, at the time, quite foreign to my way of working:
```
$ cc tryit.c && ./a.out

```
Look! His actual program, conceived(构思) just a few minutes earlier, was now up and running. We tried a few values and confirmed my suspicions (so I'd been right about something!) and then he cross-checked the relevant section of K&R. I thanked Hoppy and left, again taking care not to disturb his cola can pyramid.

Back at my own desk, I closed down my IDE. I'd become so used to working on a big project within a big product I'd started to think that was what I should be doing. A general purpose computer can do little tasks too. I opened a text editor and began typing.
```
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    printf("Hello, World\n");
    return 0;
}
```
#### [Let Your Project Speak for Itself](https://97-things-every-x-should-know.gitbooks.io/97-things-every-programmer-should-know/content/en/thing_52/)
Your project probably has a version control system in place. Perhaps it is connected to a continuous integration (持续集成)server that verifies correctness by automated tests. That's great.

You can include tools for static code analysis into your continuous integration server to gather code metrics. These metrics provide feedback about specific aspects of your code, as well as their evolution over time. When you install code metrics, there will always be a red line that you do not want to cross. Let's assume you started with 20% test coverage and never want to fall below 15%. Continuous integration helps you keep track of all these numbers, but you still have to check regularly. Imagine you could delegate this task to the project itself and rely on it to report when things get worse.
You need to give your project a voice. This can be done by email or instant messaging, informing the developers about the latest decline or improvement in numbers. But it's even more effective to embody the project in your office by using an extreme feedback device (XFD).

The idea of XFDs is to drive a physical device such as a lamp, a portable fountain, a toy robot, or even an USB rocket launcher, based on the results of the automatic analysis. Whenever your limits are broken, the device alters its state. In case of a lamp, it will light up, bright and obvious. You can't miss the message even if you're hurrying out the door to get home.

Depending on the type of extreme feedback device, you can hear the build break, see the red warning signals in your code, or even smell your code smells. The devices can be replicated(复制) at different locations if you work on a distributed team. You can place a traffic light in your project manager's office, indicating overall project health state. Your project manager will appreciate it.

Let your creativity guide you in choosing an appropriate device. If your culture is rather geeky, you might look for ways to equip your team mascot with radio-controlled toys. If you want a more professional look, invest in sleek designer lamps. Search the Internet for more inspiration. Anything with a power plug or a remote control has the potential to be used as an extreme feedback device.

The extreme feedback device acts as the voice box of your project. The project now resides physically with the developers, complaining or praising them according to the rules the team has chosen. You can drive this personification further by applying speech synthesis software and a pair of loudspeakers. Now your project really speaks for itself.

summary 

设置一些指标，在持续集成的时候如果某些指标有问题，让系统通过某些方式通知开发者。例如，邮件，即时通讯，或者一些物理设备，比如灯这类的。
