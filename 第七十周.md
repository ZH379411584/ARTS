#### [Testing Is the Engineering Rigor of Software Development  测试是软件开发的工程严谨](https://97-things-every-x-should-know.gitbooks.io/97-things-every-programmer-should-know/content/en/thing_83/)
Developers love to use tortured metaphors(折磨的隐喻) when trying to explain what it is they do to family members, spouses, and other non-techies. We frequently resort（采用） to bridge building and other "hard" engineering disciplines. All these metaphors fall down quickly, though, when you start trying to push them too hard. It turns out that software development is not like many of the "hard" engineering disciplines in lots of important ways.

Compared to "hard"（硬） engineering, the software development world is at about the same place the bridge builders were when the common strategy was to build a bridge and then roll something heavy over it. If it stayed up, it was a good bridge. If not, well, time to go back to the drawing board. Over the past few thousand years, engineers have developed mathematics and physics they can use for a structural solution without having to build it to see what it does. We don't have anything like that in software, and perhaps never will because software is in fact very different. For a deep-dive exploration of the comparison between software "engineering" and regular engineering, "What is Software Design?", written by Jack Reeves in C++ Journal in 1992, is a classic. Even though it was written almost two decades ago, it is still remarkably accurate. He painted a gloomy picture in this comparison, but the thing that was missing in 1992 was a strong testing ethos（精神） for software.

Testing "hard" things is tough because you have to build them to test them, which discourages speculative（不鼓励投机） building just to see what will happen. But the building process in software is ridiculously cheap. We've developed an entire ecosystem of tools that make it easy to do just that: unit testing, mock objects, test harnesses, and lots of other stuff. Other engineers would love to be able to build something and test it under realistic conditions. As software developers, we should embrace testing as the primary (but not the only) verification mechanism for software. Rather than waiting for some sort of calculus（某种微积分） for software, we already have the tools at our disposal to ensure good engineering practices. Viewed in this light, we now have ammunition against managers who tell us "We don't have time to test." A bridge builder would never hear from their boss "Don't bother doing structural analysis on that building — we have a tight deadline." The recognition that testing is indeed the path to reproducibility and quality in software allows us as developers to push back on arguments against it as professionally irresponsible.

Testing takes time, just like structural analysis takes time. Both activities ensure the quality of the end product. It's time for software developers to take up the mantle of responsibility for what they produce. Testing alone isn't sufficient, but it is necessary. Testing is the engineering rigor of software development.

#### [Thinking in States](https://97-things-every-x-should-know.gitbooks.io/97-things-every-programmer-should-know/content/en/thing_84/)
People in the real world have a weird(奇怪的) relationship with state. This morning I stopped by the local store to prepare for another day of converting caffeine to code. Since my favorite way of doing that is by drinking latte, and I couldn't find any milk, I asked the clerk.

"Sorry, we're super-duper, mega-out of milk.(超级浓缩牛奶)"

To a programmer, that's an odd(奇怪的) statement. You're either out of milk or you're not. There is no scale when it comes to being out of milk. Perhaps she was trying to tell me that they'd be out of milk for a week, but the outcome was the same — espresso day for me.

In most real-world situations, people's relaxed attitude to state is not an issue. Unfortunately, however, many programmers are quite vague(模糊) about state too — and that is a problem.

Consider a simple webshop that only accepts credit cards and does not invoice（发票） customers, with an Order class containing this method:
```
 public boolean isComplete() {
     return isPaid() && hasShipped();
 }
```
Reasonable, right? Well, even if the expression is nicely extracted into a method instead of copy'n'pasted everywhere, the expression shouldn't exist at all. The fact that it does highlights a problem. Why? Because an order can't be shipped before it's paid. Thereby, hasShipped can't be true unless isPaid is true, which makes part of the expression redundant. You may still want isComplete for clarity in the code, but then it should look like this:
```
public boolean isComplete() {
     return hasShipped();
 }
```
in my work, I see both missing checks and redundant checks all the time. This example is tiny, but when you add cancellation and repayment, it'll become more complex and the need for good state handling increases. In this case, an order can only be in one of three distinct states:
- In progress: Can add or remove items. Can't ship.
- Paid: Can't add or remove items. Can be shipped.
- Shipped: Done. No more changes accepted.

These states are important and you need to check that you're in the expected state before doing operations, and that you only move to a legal state from where you are. In short, you have to protect your objects carefully, in the right places.

But how do you begin thinking in states? Extracting（提取） expressions to meaningful methods is a very good start, but it is just a start. The foundation is to understand state machines. I know you may have bad memories from CS class, but leave them behind. State machines are not particularly hard. Visualize them to make them simple to understand and easy to talk about. Test-drive your code to unravel valid and invalid states and transitions and to keep them correct. Study the State pattern. When you feel comfortable, read up on Design by Contract（合同）. It helps you ensure a valid state by validating incoming data and the object itself on entry and exit of each public method.

If your state is incorrect, there's a bug and you risk trashing data if you don't abort. If you find the state checks to be noise, learn how to use a tool, code generation, weaving, or aspects to hide them. Regardless of which approach you pick, thinking in states will make your code simpler and more robust.

#### [Two Heads Are Often Better than One](https://97-things-every-x-should-know.gitbooks.io/97-things-every-programmer-should-know/content/en/thing_85/)
Programming requires deep thought, and deep thought requires solitude(处). So goes the programmer stereotype(刻板印象).

This "lone wolf" approach to programming has been giving way to a more collaborative（合作的） approach, which, I would argue, improves quality, productivity, and job satisfaction（满意） for programmers. This approach has developers working more closely with each other and also with non-developers — business and systems analysts, quality assurance professionals, and users.

What does this mean for developers? Being the expert（专家） technologist is no longer sufficient. You must become effective at working with others.
Collaboration is not about asking and answering questions or sitting in meetings. It's about rolling up your sleeves（袖子） with someone else to jointly（共同） attack work.I'm a big fan of pair programming. You might call this "extreme(极端) collaboration." As a developer, my skills grow when I pair. If I am weaker than my pairing partner in the domain or technology, I clearly learn from his or her experience. When I am stronger in some aspect, I learn more about what I know and don't know by having to explain myself. Invariably(总是), we both bring something to the table and learn from each other.

When pairing, we each bring our collective(集体) programming experiences — domain as well as technical — to the problem at hand and can bring unique insight and experience into writing software effectively and efficiently. Even in cases of extreme imbalance in domain or technical knowledge, the more experienced participant invariably learns something from the other — perhaps a new keyboard shortcut, or exposure to a new tool or library. For the less-experienced member of the pair, this is a great way to get up to speed.

Pair programming is popular with, though not exclusive(独家) to, proponents(支持者) of agile(敏捷) software development. Some who object to pairing suggest "Why should I pay two programmers to do the work of one?" My response is that, indeed, you should not. I argue that pairing increases quality, understanding of the domain and technology, techniques (like IDE tricks), and mitigates(减轻) the impact of lottery(彩票) risk (one of your expert developers wins the lottery（彩票） and quits the next day).

What is the long-term（长期） value of learning a new keyboard shortcut? How do we measure the overall（总体） quality improvement to the product resulting from pairing? How do we measure the impact of your partner not letting you pursue（追求） a dead-end approach to solving a difficult problem? One study cites an increase of 40% in effectiveness and speed (J T Nosek, "The Case for Collaborative Programming," Communications of the ACM, March 1998). What is the value of mitigating（减轻） your "lottery risk?" Most of these gains are difficult to measure.

Who should pair with whom? If you're new to the team, it's important to find a team member who is knowledgeable. Just as important find someone who has good interpersonal（人际交往） and coaching skills. If you don't have much domain experience, pair with a team member who is an expert in the domain.
If you are not convinced, experiment: collaborate with your colleagues. Pair on an interesting, gnarly（棘手的） problem. See how it feels. Try it a few times.
