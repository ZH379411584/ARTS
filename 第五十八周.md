#### [Know Your Next Commit](https://97-things-every-x-should-know.gitbooks.io/97-things-every-programmer-should-know/content/en/thing_47/)
I tapped three programmers on their shoulders and asked what they were doing. "I am refactoring these methods," the first answered. "I am adding some parameters to this web action," the second answered. The third answered, "I am working on this user story."

It might seem that the first two were engrossed in the details of their work while only the third could see the bigger picture, and that the latter had the better focus. However, when I asked when and what they would commit, the picture changed dramatically. The first two where pretty clear over what files would be involved and would be finished within an hour or so. The third programmer answered, "Oh, I guess I will be ready within a few days. I will probably add a few classes and might change those services in some way."

The first two did not lack a vision of the overall goal. They had selected tasks they thought led in a productive direction, and could be finished within a couple of hours. Once they had finished those tasks, they would select a new feature or refactoring to work on. All the code written was thus done with a clear purpose and a limited, achievable goal in mind.

The third programmer had not been able to decompose（分解） the problem and was working on all aspects at once. He had no idea of what it would take, basically doing speculative（投机的） programming, hoping to arrive at some point where he would be able to commit. Most probably the code written at the start of this long session was poorly matched for the solution that came out in the end.

What would the first two programmers do if their tasks took more than two hours? After realizing they had taken on too much, they would most likely throw away their changes, define smaller tasks, and start over. To keep working would have lacked focus and led to speculative code entering the repository. Instead, changes would be thrown away（扔掉）, but the insights kept.

The third programmer might keep on guessing and desperately try to patch together his changes into something that could be committed. After all, you cannot throw away code changes you have done — that would be wasted work, wouldn't it? Unfortunately, not throwing the code away leads to slightly odd code that lacks a clear purpose entering the repository.

At some point even the commit-focused programmers might fail to find something useful they thought could be finished in two hours. Then, they would go directly into speculative mode, playing around with the code and, of course, throwing away the changes whenever some insight led them back on track. Even these seemingly unstructured hacking sessions have purpose: to learn about the code to be able to define a task that would constitute a productive step.

Know your next commit. If you cannot finish, throw away your changes, then define a new task you believe in with the insights you have gained. Do speculative experimentation whenever needed, but do not let yourself slip into speculative mode without noticing. Do not commit guesswork into your repository.

#### [Large Interconnected Data Belongs to a Database 大型互连数据属于数据库](https://97-things-every-x-should-know.gitbooks.io/97-things-every-programmer-should-know/content/en/thing_48/)

If your application is going to handle a large, persistent, interconnected set of data elements, don't hesitate to store it in a relational database. In the past RDBMSs used to be expensive, scarce(稀缺), complex, and unwieldy beasts（笨拙的野兽）. This is no longer the case. Nowadays RDBMS systems are easy to find — it is likely that the system you're using has already one or two installed. Some very capable RDBMSs, like MySQL and PostgreSQL, are available as open source software, so cost of purchase is no longer an issue. Even better, so-called embedded database systems can be linked as libraries directly into your application, requiring almost no setup or management — two notable（显著的） open source ones are SQLite and HSQLDB. These systems are extremely efficient.

If your application's data is larger than the system's RAM, an indexed RDBMS table will perform orders of magnitude（数量级） faster than your library's map collection type, which will thrash virtual memory pages.（跳动虚拟内存页面） Modern database offerings can easily grow with your needs. With proper care, you can scale up an embedded database to a larger database system when required. Later on you can switch from a free, open source offering to a better-supported or more powerful proprietary system.

Once you get the hang of SQL, writing database-centric applications is a joy. After you've stored your properly normalized data in the database it's easy to extract facts efficiently with a readable SQL query; there's no need to write any complex code. Similarly, a single SQL command can perform complex data changes. For one-off（一次性） modifications, say a change in the way you organize your persistent data, you don't even need to write code: Just fire up the database's direct SQL interface. This same interface also allows you to experiment with queries, sidestepping（避开） a regular programming language's compile–edit cycle（编译-编辑周期）.

Another advantage of basing your code around an RDBMS involves（涉及） the handling of relationships between your data elements. You can describe consistency constraints on your data in a declarative way, avoiding the risk of the dangling pointers you get if you forget to update your data in an edge case. For example, you can specify that if a user is deleted then the messages sent by that user should be removed as well.

You can also create efficient links between the entities stored in the database anytime you want, simply by creating an index. There is no need to perform expensive and extensive refactorings of class fields. In addition, coding around a database allows multiple applications to access your data in a safe way. This makes it easy to upgrade your application for concurrent use and also to code each part of your application using the most appropriate language and platform. For instance, you could write the XML back-end of a web-based application in Java, some auditing scripts in Ruby, and a visualization interface in Processing.

Finally, keep in mind that the RDBMS will sweat hard to optimize your SQL commands, allowing you to concentrate on your application's functionality rather than on algorithmic tuning. Advanced database systems will even take advantage of multicore processors behind your back. And, as technology improves, so will your application's performance.

如果您的应用程序要处理大量的，持久的，相互关联的数据元素，请毫不犹豫地将其存储在关系数据库中。

#### [Learn Foreign Languages](https://97-things-every-x-should-know.gitbooks.io/97-things-every-programmer-should-know/content/en/thing_49/)
Programmers need to communicate. A lot.

There are periods in a programmer's life when most communication seems to be with the computer. More precisely(更确切地说), with the programs running on that computer. This communication is about expressing ideas in a machine-readable way. It remains an exhilarating(令人振奋的) prospect: Programs are ideas turned into(转换成) reality, with virtually no physical substance involved.(几乎不涉及任何物理物质。)

Programmers need to be fluent in the language of the machine, whether real or virtual, and in the abstractions that can be related to that language via development tools. It is important to learn many different abstractions, otherwise some ideas become incredibly hard to express. Good programmers need to be able to stand outside their daily routine, to be aware of other languages that are expressive for other purposes. The time always comes when this pays off.

Beyond communication with machines, programmers need to communicate with their peers(同行). Today's large projects are more social endeavors（努力） than simply an application of the art of programming. It is important to understand and express more than the machine-readable abstractions can. Most of the best programmers I know are also very fluent in their mother's tongue, and typically in other languages as well. This is not just about communication with others: Speaking a language well also leads to a clarity（清晰） of thought that is indispensable（必不可少的） when abstracting a problem. And this is what programming is also about.

Beyond communication with machine, self, and peers, a project has many stakeholders（利益相关者）, most with a different or no technical background. They live in testing, quality and deployment, in marketing and sales, they are end（最终） users in some office (or store or home). You need to understand them and their concerns. This is almost impossible if you cannot speak their language — the language of their world, their domain. While you might think a conversation with them went well, they probably don't.

If you talk to accountants（会计师）, you need a basic knowledge of cost-center accounting, of tied capital, capital employed, et al. If you talk to marketing or lawyers, some of their jargon and language (and thus, their minds) should be familiar to you. All these domain-specific languages need to be mastered by someone in the project — ideally（理想地） the programmers. Programmers are ultimately（最终） responsible for bringing the ideas to life via a computer.

And, of course, life is more than software projects. As noted by Charlemagne, to know another language is to have another soul. For your contacts beyond the software industry, you will appreciate knowing foreign languages. To know when to listen rather than talk. To know that most language is without words.

```
Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent. - Ludwig Wittgenstein
不能说话的场合就保持沉默。
```
summary   
学习一门“外语“。做为一名程序员，你需要和计算机沟通，和同事沟通，和使用软件的人沟通。我们写程序就是将各种其他行业的想法转化成计算机能读懂的语言。
当然，生活不只是软件项目。了解一门其他的语言，你会拥有另一种思维。
