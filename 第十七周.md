### Errors inside a transaction
During a transaction it is possible to encounter two kind of command errors:

- A command may fail to be queued, so there may be an error before EXEC is called. For instance the command may be syntactically wrong (wrong number of arguments, wrong command name, ...), or there may be some critical condition like an out of memory condition (if the server is configured to have a memory limit using the maxmemory directive).

- A command may fail after EXEC is called, for instance since we performed an operation against a key with the wrong value (like calling a list operation against a string value).


### Why Redis does not support roll backs?
- Redis commands can fail only if called with a wrong syntax (and the problem is not detectable during the command queueing), or against keys holding the wrong data type: this means that in practical terms a failing command is the result of a programming errors, and a kind of error that is very likely to be detected during development, and not in production.(这是一种编程错误导致的结果，这类错误很可能在开发环境中提现发现，而不是到了生产环境中才发现)
- Redis is internally simplified and faster because it does not need the ability to roll back.
