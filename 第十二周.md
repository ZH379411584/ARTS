#### HTML is the Web（Excerpt first paragraph）
What’s the story with Frontend Engineers and HTML these days?
I’ve been speaking to quite a few recently who just don’t seem to understand it. 
I mean, they understand some of it. They understand what a div is and what a span is,
and as long as it all looks good and works when they click on it, they’re happy enough. 
So many that I’ve spoken to have answered questions about HTML with things like “Oh, 
I do everything in React or Vue these days”. But really, it doesn’t matter if all you write is Javascript,
because if you’re making websites then the most important thing you’re making is HTML.
