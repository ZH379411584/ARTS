#### [Start from Yes](https://97-things-every-x-should-know.gitbooks.io/97-things-every-programmer-should-know/content/en/thing_77/)
Recently I was at a grocery store searching high and low for "edamame" (which I only vaguely knew was some kind of a vegetable). I wasn't sure whether this was something I'd find in the vegetable section, the frozen section, or in a can. I gave up and tracked down an employee to help me out. She didn't know either!

The employee could have responded in many different ways. She could have made me feel ignorant for not knowing where to look, or given me vague possibilities, or even just told me they didn't have the item. But instead she treated the request as an opportunity to find a solution and help a customer. She called other employees and within minutes had guided me to the exact item, nestled in the frozen section.

The employee in this case looked at a request and started from the premise(前提) that we would solve the problem and satisfy the request. She started from yes instead of starting from no.

When I was first placed in a technical leadership role, I felt that my job was to protect my beautiful software from the ridiculous stream of demands coming from product managers and business analysts. I started most conversations seeing a request as something to defeat(打败), not something to grant.

At some point, I had an epiphany（顿悟） that maybe there was a different way to work that merely involved shifting my perspective from starting at no to starting at yes. In fact, I've come to believe that starting from yes is actually an essential part of being a technical leader.

This simple change radically altered how I approached my job. As it turns out, there are a lot of ways to say yes. When someone says to you "Hey, this app would really be the bees knees if we made all the windows round and translucent!" you could reject it as ridiculous. But it's often better to start with "Why?" instead. Often there is some actual and compelling reason why that person is asking for round translucent windows in the first place. For example, you may be just about to sign a big new customer with a standards committee that mandates round translucent（圆形半透明） windows.

Usually you'll find that when you known the context of the request, new possibilities open up. It's common for the request to be accomplished with the existing product in some other way allowing you to say yes with no work at all: "Actually, in the user preferences you can download the round translucent windows skin and turn it on."

Sometimes the other person will simply have an idea that you find incompatible（不相容） with your view of the product. I find it's usually helpful to turn that "Why?" on yourself. Sometimes the act of voicing the reason will make it clear that your first reaction doesn't make sense（没有道理）. If not, you might need to kick it up a notch and bring in other key decision makers. Remember, the goal of all of this is to say yes to the other person and try to make it work, not just for him but for you and your team as well.

If you can voice a compelling explanation as to why the feature request is incompatible with the existing product, then you are likely to have a productive conversation about whether you are building the right product. Regardless of how that conversation concludes, everyone will focus more sharply on what the product is, and what it is not.

Starting from yes means working with your colleagues, not against them.

别一开始就拒绝，你需要了解这个东西是为什么，你需要理性的分析。

#### [Step Back and Automate, Automate, Automate 退后和自动化，自动化](https://97-things-every-x-should-know.gitbooks.io/97-things-every-programmer-should-know/content/en/thing_78/)
I worked with programmers who, when asked to produce a count of the lines of code in a module, pasted the files into a word processor and used its "line count" feature. And they did it again next week. And the week after. It was bad.

I worked on a project that had a cumbersome（麻烦的） deployment process, involving code signing and moving the result to a server, requiring many mouse clicks. Someone automated it and the script ran hundreds of times during final testing, far more often than anticipated（预期的）. It was good.

So, why do people do the same task over and over instead of stepping back and taking the time to automate it?

##### Common misconception（误解） #1: Automation is only for testing.
Sure, test automation is great, but why stop there? Repetitive（重复性） tasks abound in any project: version control, compiling, building JAR files, documentation generation, deployment, and reporting. For many of these tasks, the script is mightier than the mouse. Executing tedious（乏味） tasks becomes faster and more reliable.
##### Common misconception #2: I have an IDE, so I don't have to automate.
Did you ever have a "But it (checks out|builds|passes tests) on my machine?" argument with your teammates? Modern IDEs have thousands of potential settings, and it is essentially impossible to ensure that all team members have identical（相同） configurations. Build automation systems such as Ant or Autotools give you control and repeatability.

##### Common misconception #3: I need to learn exotic tools in order to automate.
You can go a long way with a decent shell language (such as bash or PowerShell) and a build automation system. If you need to interact with web sites, use a tool such as iMacros or Selenium.

##### Common misconception #4: I can't automate this task because I can't deal with these file formats.
If a part of your process requires Word documents, spreadsheets, or images, it may indeed be challenging to automate it. But is that really necessary? Can you use plain text? Comma-separated values? XML? A tool that generates a drawing from a text file? Often, a slight tweak（调整） in the process can yield good results with a dramatic（极大地） reduction in tediousness（乏味）.
##### Common misconception #5: I don't have the time to figure it out.（想办法）
You don't have to learn all of bash or Ant to get started. Learn as you go. When you have a task that you think can and should be automated, learn just enough about your tools to do it. And do it early in a project when time is usually easier to find. Once you have been successful, you (and your boss) will see that it makes sense to invest in automation.

#### [Take Advantage of Code Analysis Tools](https://97-things-every-x-should-know.gitbooks.io/97-things-every-programmer-should-know/content/en/thing_79/)
The value of testing is something that is drummed into(传授) software developers from the early stages of their programming journey. In recent years the rise of unit testing, test-driven development, and agile(敏捷) methods has seen a surge of interest in making the most of testing throughout all phases of the development cycle. However, testing is just one of many tools that you can use to improve the quality of code.

Back in the mists of time, when C was still a new phenomenon, CPU time and storage of any kind were at a premium(宝贵). The first C compilers were mindful of this and so cut down on the number of passes through the code they made by removing some semantic（语义的） analyses. This meant that the compiler checked for only a small subset of the bugs that could be detected at compile time. To compensate, Stephen Johnson wrote a tool called lint — which removes the fluff from your code — that implemented some of the static analyses that had been removed from its sister C compiler. Static analysis tools, however, gained a reputation for giving large numbers of false-positive warnings and warnings about stylistic conventions that aren't always necessary to follow.

The current landscape（格局） of languages, compilers, and static analysis tools is very different. Memory and CPU time are now relatively cheap, so compilers can afford to check for more errors. Almost every language boasts at least one tool that checks for violations of style guides, common gotchas, and sometimes cunning errors that can be difficult to catch, such as potential null pointer dereferences. The more sophisticated tools, such as Splint for C or Pylint for Python, are configurable, meaning that you can choose which errors and warnings the tool emits with a configuration file, via command line switches, or in your IDE. Splint will even let you annotate your code in comments to give it better hints about how your program works.

If all else fails, and you find yourself looking for simple bugs or standards violations which are not caught by your compiler, IDE, or lint tools, then you can always roll your own static checker. This is not as difficult as it might sound. Most languages, particularly ones branded dynamic, expose their abstract syntax tree and compiler tools as part of their standard library. It is well worth getting to know the dusty corners of standard libraries that are used by the development team of the language you are using, as these often contain hidden gems that are useful for static analysis and dynamic testing. For example, the Python standard library contains a disassembler which tells you the bytecode used to generate some compiled code or code object. This sounds like an obscure tool for compiler writers on the python-dev team, but it is actually surprisingly useful in everyday situations. One thing this library can disassemble is your last stack trace, giving you feedback on exactly which bytecode instruction threw the last uncaught exception.

So, don't let testing be the end of your quality assurance — take advantage of analysis tools and don't be afraid to roll your own.
