#### 《Effective java》 Chapter1 Introduction

Most of the rules in this book derive from a few fundamental principles. Clarity and simplicity are of paramount（最） importance. The user of a module should never be surprised by its behavior. Modules should be as small as possible but no smaller. (As used in this book, the term module refers to any reusable software component, from an individual method to a complex system consisting of multiple packages.) Code should be reused rather than copied. The dependencies between modules should be kept to a minimum. Errors should be detected as soon as possi- ble after they are made, ideally at compile time.

- 清晰和简洁是最重要的。
- 模块要尽可能小，单有不能太小。（此模块指的是 任何可重用的软件组件，从单个方法，到包含多个包的复杂系统）
- 代码应该尽可能被复用，而不是拷贝。
- 模块之间的依赖性应该尽可能降到最小。
- 错误应该尽早的被检测出来，最好在编译时刻。
