#### [Test for Required Behavior, not Incidental(偶然的) Behavior](https://97-things-every-x-should-know.gitbooks.io/97-things-every-programmer-should-know/content/en/thing_80/)
A common pitfall（陷阱） in testing is to assume that exactly what an implementation does is precisely（恰恰） what you want to test for. At first glance this sounds more like a virtue（美德） than a pitfall. Phrased another way, however, the issue becomes more obvious: A common pitfall in testing is to hardwire tests to the specifics of an implementation, where those specifics are incidental and have no bearing on the desired（想要的） functionality.

When tests are hardwired（硬连线） to implementation incidentals, changes to the implementation that are actually compatible with the required behavior may cause tests to fail, leading to false positives. Programmers typically respond either by rewriting the test or by rewriting the code. Assuming that a false positive is actually a true positive is often a consequence of fear, uncertainty, or doubt. It has the effect of raising the status of incidental behavior to required behavior. In rewriting a test, programmers either refocus the test on the required behavior (good) or simply hardwire it to the new implementation (not good). Tests need to be sufficiently precise（精确）, but they also need to be accurate.

For example, in a three-way comparison, such as C's strcmp or Java's String.compareTo, the requirements on the result are that it is negative if the left-hand side is less than the right, positive if the left-hand side is greater than the right, and zero if they are considered equal. This style of comparison is used in many APIs, including the comparator for C's qsort function and compareTo in Java's Comparable interface. Although the specific values -1 and +1 are commonly used in implementations to signify less than and greater than, respectively, programmers often mistakenly assume that these values represent the actual requirement and consequently write tests that nail this assumption up in public.

A similar issue arises with tests that assert spacing, precise wording, and other aspects of textual formatting and presentation that are incidental. Unless you are writing, for example, an XML generator that offers configurable formatting, spacing(间距） should not be significant to the outcome. Likewise, hardwiring placement of buttons and labels on UI controls reduces the option to change and refine these incidentals in future. Minor changes in implementation and inconsequential（无关紧要的） changes in formatting suddenly become build breakers.

Overspecified tests are often a problem with whitebox approaches to unit testing. Whitebox tests use the structure of the code to determine the test cases needed. The typical failure mode of whitebox testing is that the tests end up asserting that the code does what the code does. Simply restating what is already obvious from the code adds no value and leads to a false sense of progress and security.

To be effective, tests need to state contractual obligations rather than parrot implementations. They need to take a blackbox（黑箱） view of the units under test, sketching out（勾画出来） the interface contracts in executable form. Therefore, align（对齐
） tested behavior with required behavior.

#### [Test Precisely and Concretely](https://97-things-every-x-should-know.gitbooks.io/97-things-every-programmer-should-know/content/en/thing_81/)
It is important to test for the desired, essential behavior of a unit of code, rather than test for the incidental behavior of its particular implementation. But this should not be taken or mistaken as an excuse for vague(模糊) tests. Tests need to be both accurate and precise.(准确而精确)

Something of a tried, tested, and testing classic, sorting routines offer an illustrative example. Implementing a sorting algorithm is not necessarily an everyday task for a programmer, but sorting is such a familiar idea that most people believe they know what to expect from it. This casual（偶然的） familiarity, however, can make it harder to see past certain assumptions.

When programmers are asked "What would you test for?" by far and away the most common response is "The result of sorting is a sorted sequence of elements." While this is true, it is not the whole truth. When prompted for a more precise condition, many programmers add that the resulting sequence should be the same length as the original. Although correct, this is still not enough. For example, given the following sequence:

```
3 1 4 1 5 9
```
The following sequence satisfies a postcondition of being sorted in non-descending order and having the same length as the original sequence:

```
3 3 3 3 3 3

```
Although it satisfies the spec（规格）, it is also most certainly not what was meant! This example is based on an error taken from real production code (fortunately caught before it was released), where a simple slip of a keystroke or a momentary lapse of reason led to an elaborate mechanism for populating the whole result with the first element of the given array.

The full postcondition（后置条件） is that the result is sorted and that it holds a permutation（排列） of the original values. This appropriately constrains the required behavior. That the result length is the same as the input length comes out in the wash and doesn't need restating.

Even stating the postcondition in the way described is not enough to give you a good test. A good test should be readable. It should be comprehensible and simple enough that you can see readily that it is correct (or not). Unless you already have code lying around for checking that a sequence is sorted and that one sequence contains a permutation of values in another, it is quite likely that the test code will be more complex than the code under test. As Tony Hoare observed:

```
There are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies and the other is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies.

```
Using concrete examples eliminates this accidental complexity and opportunity for accident. For example, given the following sequence:
```
3 1 4 1 5 9
```
The result of sorting is the following:
```
1 1 3 4 5 9
```
No other answer will do. Accept no substitutes.

Concrete examples helps to illustrate general behavior in an accessible and unambiguous（明确的） way. The result of adding an item to an empty collection is not simply that it is not empty: It is that the collection now has a single item. And that the single item held is the item added. Two or more items would qualify as not empty. And would also be wrong. A single item of a different value would also be wrong. The result of adding a row to a table is not simply that the table is one row bigger. It also entails that the row's key can be used to recover the row added. And so on.

In specifying behavior, tests should not simply be accurate（准确）: They must also be precise（精确）。

#### [Test While You Sleep (and over Weekends](https://97-things-every-x-should-know.gitbooks.io/97-things-every-programmer-should-know/content/en/thing_82/)
Relax. I am not referring to offshore development centers, overtime on weekends, or working the night shift. Rather, I want to draw your attention to how much computing power we have at our disposal（在我们的处置）. Specifically, how much we are not harnessing（利用） to make our lives as programmers a little easier. Are you constantly finding it difficult to get enough computing power during the work day? If so, what are your test servers doing outside of normal work hours? More often than not, the test servers are idling（空转） overnight and over the weekend. You can use this to your advantage.

- Have you been guilty of committing a change without running all the tests? One of the main reasons programmers don't run test suites before committing code is because of the length of time they may take. When deadlines are looming and push comes to shove, humans naturally start cutting corners（偷工减料）. One way to address this is to break down your large test suite into two or more profiles. A smaller, mandatory（强制性的） test profile that is quick to run, will help to ensure that tests are run before each commit. All of the test profiles (including the mandatory profile — just to be sure) can be automated to run overnight, ready to report their results in the morning.

- Have you had enough opportunity to test the stability of your product? Longer-running tests are vital for identifying memory leaks and other stability issues. They are seldom run during the day as it will tie up time and resources. You could automate a soak test to be run during the night, and a bit longer over the weekend. From 6.00 pm Friday to 6.00 am the following Monday there are 60 hours worth of potential testing time.

- Are you getting quality time on your Performance testing environment? I have seen teams bickering with（吵架） each other to get time on the performance testing environment. In most cases neither team gets enough quality time during the day, while the environment is virtually idle after hours. The servers and the network are not as busy during the night or over the weekend. It's an ideal time to run some quality performance tests.

- Are there too many permutations（排列） to test manually? In many cases your product is targeted to run on a variety of platforms. For example, both 32-bit and 64-bit, on Linux, Solaris, and Windows, or simply on different versions of the same operating system. To make matters worse, many modern applications expose themselves to a plethora of transport mechanisms and protocols (HTTP, AMQP, SOAP, CORBA, etc.). Manually testing all of these permutations is very time consuming and most likely done close to a release due to resource pressure. Alas, it may be too late in the cycle to catch certain nasty bugs.

Automated tests run during the night or over weekends will ensure all these permutations（排列） are tested more often. With a little bit of thinking and some scripting knowledge, you can schedule a few cron jobs to kick off（开始）some testing at night and over the weekend. There are also many testing tools out there that could help. Some organizations even have server grids that pool servers across different departments and teams to ensure that resources are utilized efficiently. If this is available in your organization, you can submit tests to be run at night or over weekends.

summary

在夜晚或者周末进行测试，你可以充分利用这些服务器空闲的时间。
