#### [Encapsulate Behavior, not Just State 封装行为，而不仅仅是状态](https://97-things-every-x-should-know.gitbooks.io/97-things-every-programmer-should-know/content/en/thing_32/)

In systems theory, containment is one of the most useful constructs when dealing with large and complex system structures. In the software industry the value of containment or encapsulation is well understood. Containment is supported by programming language constructs such as subroutines(子程序) and functions, modules and packages, classes, and so on.

Modules and packages address the larger scale needs for encapsulation, while classes, subroutines, and functions address the more fine-grained(细颗粒的) aspects of the matter. Over the years I have discovered that classes seem to be one of the hardest encapsulation constructs for developers to get right. It's not uncommon to find a class with a single 3000-line main method, or a class with only set and get methods for its primitive attributes. These examples demonstrate that the developers involved have not fully understood object-oriented thinking, having failed to take advantage of the power of objects as modeling constructs. For developers familiar with the terms POJO (Plain Old Java Object) and POCO (Plain Old C# Object or Plain Old CLR Object), this was the intent in going back to the basics of OO as a modeling paradigm(范例) — the objects are plain and simple, but not dumb.

An object encapsulates both state and behavior, where the behavior is defined by the actual state. Consider a door object. It has four states: closed, open, closing, opening. It provides two operations: open and close. Depending on the state, the open and close operations will behave differently. This inherent property of an object makes the design process conceptually simple. It boils down(归结) to two simple tasks: allocation and delegation of responsibility to the different objects including the inter-object interaction protocols.（对不同对象（包括对象间交互协议）的责任进行分配和委派。）

How this works in practice is best illustrated with an example. Let's say we have three classes: Customer, Order, and Item. A Customer object is the natural placeholder for the credit limit and credit validation rules. An Order object knows about its associated Customer, and its addItem operation delegates（委托） the actual credit check by calling customer.validateCredit(item.price()). If the postcondition for the method fails, an exception can be thrown and the purchase aborted.

Less experienced object oriented developers might decide to wrap all the business rules into an object very often referred to as OrderManager or OrderService. In these designs, Order, Customer, and Item are treated as little more than record types. All logic is factored out（排除） of the classes and tied together in one large, procedural method with a lot of internal if-then-else constructs. These methods are easily broken and are almost impossible to maintain. The reason? The encapsulation is broken.
So in the end, don't break the encapsulation, and use the power of your programming language to maintain it.
##### summary  
对象的行为应该封装在对象中，而不是写在一个方法中。比如，Customer, Order, and Item这个三个对象，order addItem的时候，需要调用validateCredit方法验证客户的信用 ，这个验证方法应该是分装在 customer对象中，而不是在 addItem方法中，addItem只是调用validateCredit。  
但在日常的开发中，我们好像都没有将这类验证的方法放置在对象中，而是放在这个对象的service层，比如上述的validateCredit方法，我们会分装到 OrderService中。
#### [Floating-point Numbers Aren't Real 浮点数不是实数](https://97-things-every-x-should-know.gitbooks.io/97-things-every-programmer-should-know/content/en/thing_33/)
Floating-point numbers are not "real numbers" in the mathematical sense, even though they are called real in some programming languages, such as Pascal and Fortran. Real numbers have infinite(无穷) precision and are therefore continuous and non-lossy; floating-point numbers have limited precision, so they are finite, and they resemble "badly-behaved" integers, because they're not evenly spaced throughout their range.

To illustrate, assign 2147483647 (the largest signed 32-bit integer) to a 32-bit float variable (x, say), and print it. You'll see 2147483648. Now print x - 64. Still 2147483648. Now print x - 65 and you'll get 2147483520! Why? Because the spacing between adjacent(相邻) floats in that range is 128, and floating-point operations round to the nearest floating-point number.

IEEE floating-point numbers are fixed-precision numbers based on base-two scientific notation: 1.d1d2...dp-1 × 2e, where p is the precision (24 for float, 53 for double). The spacing between two consecutive numbers is 21-p+e, which can be safely approximated by ε|x|, where ε is the machine epsilon (21-p).

Knowing the spacing in the neighborhood of a floating-point number can help you avoid classic numerical blunders(失误). For example, if you're performing an iterative(反复的) calculation, such as searching for the root of an equation, there's no sense in asking for greater precision than the number system can give in the neighborhood of the answer. Make sure that the tolerance you request is no smaller than the spacing there; otherwise you'll loop forever.

Since floating-point numbers are approximations of real numbers, there is inevitably a little error present. This error, called roundoff(四舍五入), can lead to surprising results. When you subtract nearly equal numbers, for example, the most significant digits cancel each other out, so what was the least significant digit (where the roundoff error resides) gets promoted to the most significant position in the floating-point result, essentially contaminating any further related computations (a phenomenon known as smearing). You need to look closely at your algorithms to prevent such catastrophic cancellation. To illustrate, consider solving the equation x2 - 100000x + 1 = 0 with the quadratic formula. Since the operands in the expression -b + sqrt(b2 - 4) are nearly equal in magnitude, you can instead compute the root r1 = -b + sqrt(b2 - 4), and then obtain r2 = 1/r1, since for any quadratic equation, ax2 + bx + c = 0, the roots satisfy r1r2 = c/a.

Smearing can occur in even more subtle ways. Suppose a library naively computes ex by the formula 1 + x + x2/2 + x3/3! + .... This works fine for positive x, but consider what happens when x is a large negative number. The even-powered terms result in large positive numbers, and subtracting the odd-powered magnitudes will not even affect the result. The problem here is that the roundoff in the large, positive terms is in a digit position of much greater significance than the true answer. The answer diverges toward positive infinity! The solution here is also simple: for negative x, compute ex = 1/e|x|.

It should go without saying that you shouldn't use floating-point numbers for financial applications — that's what decimal classes in languages like Python and C# are for. Floating-point numbers are intended for efficient scientific computation. But efficiency is worthless without accuracy, so remember the source of rounding errors and code accordingly!

#### [Fulfill Your Ambitions with Open Source 用开源实现您的抱负](https://97-things-every-x-should-know.gitbooks.io/97-things-every-programmer-should-know/content/en/thing_34/)

Chances are pretty good that you are not developing software at work that fulfills your most ambitious software development daydreams. Perhaps you are developing software for a huge insurance company when you would rather be working at Google, Apple, Microsoft, or your own start-up developing the next big thing. You'll never get where you want to go developing software for systems you don't care about.

Fortunately, there is an answer to your problem: open source. There are thousands of open source projects out there, many of them quite active, which offer you any kind of software development experience you could want. If you love the idea of developing operating systems, go help with one of the dozen operating system projects. If you want to work on music software, animation software, cryptography, robotics, PC games, massive online player games, mobile phones, or whatever, you'll almost certainly find at least one open source project dedicated() to that interest.

Of course there is no free lunch. You have to be willing to give up your free time because you probably cannot work on an open source video game at your day job — you still have a responsibility to your employer. In addition, very few people make money contributing to open source projects — some do but most don't. You should be willing to give up some of your free time (less time playing video games and watching TV won't kill you). The harder you work on an open source project the faster you'll realize your true ambitions as a programmer. It's also important to consider your employee contract — some employers may restrict what you can contribute, even on your own time. In addition, you need to be careful about violating intellectual property laws having to do with copyright, patents, trade marks, and trade secrets.

Open source provides enormous opportunities for the motivated(有动力) programmer. First, you get to see how someone else would implement a solution that interests you — you can learn a lot by reading other people's source code. Second, you get to contribute your own code and ideas to the project — not every brilliant idea you have will be accepted but some might and you'll learn something new just by working on solutions and contributing code. Third, you'll meet great people with the same passion for the type of software that you have — these open source friendships can last a lifetime. Fourth, assuming you are a competent contributor, you'll be able to add real-world experience in the technology that actually interests you.

Getting started with open source is pretty easy. There is a wealth of documentation out there on the tools you'll need (e.g., source code management, editors, programming languages, build systems, etc.). Find the project you want to work on first and learn about the tools that project uses. The documentation on projects themselves will be light in most cases, but this perhaps matters less because the best way to learn is to investigate the code yourself. If you want to get involved, you could offer to help out with the documentation. Or you could start by volunteering to write test code. While that may not sound exciting, the truth is you learn much faster by writing test code for other people's software than almost any other activity in software. Write test code, really good test code. Find bugs, suggest fixes, make friends, work on software you like, and fulfill your software development ambitions.
