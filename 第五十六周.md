#### [Inter-Process进程间 Communication Affects Application Response Time](https://97-things-every-x-should-know.gitbooks.io/97-things-every-programmer-should-know/content/en/thing_41/)

Response time is critical to software usability. Few things are as frustrating as waiting for some software system to respond, especially when our interaction with the software involves repeated cycles of stimulus and response. We feel as if the software is wasting our time and affecting our productivity. However, the causes of poor response time are less well appreciated, especially in modern applications. Much performance management literature still focuses on data structures and algorithms, issues that can make a difference in some cases but are far less likely to dominate performance in modern multi-tier enterprise applications（现代多层企业应用程序）.

When performance is a problem in such applications, my experience has been that examining data structures and algorithms isn't the right place to look for improvements. Response time depends most strongly on the number of remote inter-process communications (IPCs) conducted in response to a stimulus.（响应时间最强烈地取决于响应刺激而进行的远程进程间通信（IPC）的数量。） While there can be other local bottlenecks, the number of remote inter-process communications usually dominates. Each remote inter-process communication contributes some non-negligible（不可忽略的） latency to the overall（总体） response time, and these individual contributions add up, especially when they are incurred in sequence.

A prime example is ripple loading in an application using object–relational mapping.（一个典型的例子是使用对象关系映射的应用程序中的纹波加载） Ripple loading describes the sequential execution of many database calls to select the data needed for building a graph of objects (see Lazy Load in Martin Fowler's Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture). When the database client is a middle-tier application server rendering（渲染） a web page, these database calls are usually executed sequentially in a single thread. Their individual latencies accumulate, contributing to the overall response time.（它们各自的等待时间会累积，从而增加了总体响应时间。） Even if each database call takes only 10ms, a page requiring 1000 calls (which is not uncommon) will exhibit at least a 10-second response time. Other examples include web-service invocation, HTTP requests from a web browser, distributed object invocation, request–reply messaging, and data-grid interaction over custom network protocols. The more remote IPCs needed to respond to a stimulus, the greater the response time will be.

There are a few relatively（相对） obvious and well-known strategies for reducing the number of remote inter-process communications per stimulus. One strategy is to apply the principle of parsimony（简约）, optimizing the interface between processes so that exactly the right data for the purpose at hand is exchanged with the minimum amount of interaction.（最少的交互量） Another strategy is to parallelize（并行化） the inter-process communications where possible, so that the overall response time becomes driven mainly by the longest-latency IPC. A third strategy is to cache the results of previous IPCs, so that future IPCs may be avoided by hitting local cache instead.

When you're designing an application, be mindful of the number of inter-process communications in response to each stimulus. When analyzing applications that suffer from poor performance, I have often found IPC-to-stimulus ratios of thousands-to-one. Reducing this ratio, whether by caching or parallelizing or some other technique, will pay off much more than changing data structure choice or tweaking a sorting algorithm.

#### [Keep the Build Clean](https://97-things-every-x-should-know.gitbooks.io/97-things-every-programmer-should-know/content/en/thing_42/)
Have you ever looked at a list of compiler warnings the length of an essay on bad coding and thought to yourself: "You know, I really should do something about that... but I don't have time just now?" On the other hand, have you ever looked at a lone warning that just appeared in a compilation and just fixed it?

When I start a new project from scratch, there are no warnings, no clutter(混乱）, no problems. But as the code base grows, if I don't pay attention, the clutter, the cruft, the warnings, and the problems can start piling up.（堆积如山） When there's a lot of noise, it's much harder to find the warning that I really want to read among the hundreds of warnings I don't care about.

To make warnings useful again, I try to use a zero-tolerance policy for warnings from the build. Even if the warning isn't important, I deal with it. If not critical, but still relevant（相关的）, I fix it. If the compiler warns about a potential null-pointer exception, I fix the cause — even if I "know" the problem will never show up in production. If the embedded documentation (Javadoc or similar) refers to parameters that have been removed or renamed, I clean up the documentation.

If it's something I really don't care about and that really doesn't matter, I ask the team if we can change our warning policy. For example, I find that documenting the parameters and return value of a method in many cases doesn't add any value, so it shouldn't be a warning if they are missing. Or, upgrading to a new version of the programming language may make code that was previously OK now emit warnings. For example, when Java 5 introduced generics, all the old code that didn't specify the generic type parameter would give a warning. This is a sort of warning I don't want to be nagged about (at least, not yet). Having a set of warnings that are out of step with reality does not serve anyone.

By making sure that the build is always clean, I will not have to decide that a warning is irrelevant every time I encounter it. Ignoring things is mental work, and I need to get rid of all the unnecessary mental work I can. Having a clean build also makes it easier for someone else to take over my work. If I leave the warnings, someone else will have to wade through what is relevant and what is not. Or more likely, just ignore all the warnings, including the significant ones.

Warnings from your build are useful. You just need to get rid of the noise to start noticing them. Don't wait for a big clean-up. When something appears that you don't want to see, deal with it right away. Either fix the source of the warning, suppress this warning or fix the warning policies of your tool. Keeping the build clean is not just about keeping it free of compilation errors or test failures: Warnings are also an important and critical part of code hygiene.

#### [Know How to Use Command-line Tools](https://97-things-every-x-should-know.gitbooks.io/97-things-every-programmer-should-know/content/en/thing_43/)
Today, many software development tools are packaged in the form of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs). Microsoft's Visual Studio and the open-source Eclipse are two popular examples, though there are many others. There is a lot to like about IDEs. Not only are they easy to use, they also relieve(缓解) the programmer of thinking about a lot of little details involving the build process.

Ease of use, however, has its downside.(缺点) Typically, when a tool is easy to use, it's because the tool is making decisions for you and doing a lot of things automatically, behind the scenes. Thus, if an IDE is the only programming environment that you ever use, you may never fully understand what your tools are actually doing. You click a button, some magic occurs, and an executable file appears in the project folder.

By working with command-line build tools, you will learn a lot more about what the tools are doing when your project is being built. Writing your own make files will help you to understand all of the steps (compiling, assembling, linking, etc.) that go into building an executable file. Experimenting with the many command-line options for these tools is a valuable educational experience as well. To get started with using command-line build tools, you can use open-source command-line tools such as GCC or you can use the ones supplied with your proprietary IDE. After all, a well-designed IDE is just a graphical front-end to a set of command-line tools.

In addition to improving your understanding of the build process, there are some tasks that can be performed more easily or more efficiently with command-line tools than with an IDE. For example, the search and replace capabilities provided by the grep and sed utilities are often more powerful than those found in IDEs. Command-line tools inherently support scripting, which allows for the automation of tasks such as producing scheduled daily builds, creating multiple versions of a project, and running test suites. In an IDE, this kind of automation may be more difficult (if not impossible) to do as build options are usually specified using GUI dialog boxes and the build process is invoked with a mouse click. If you never step outside of the IDE, you may not even realize that these kinds of automated tasks are possible.

But wait. Doesn't the IDE exist to make development easier, and to improve the programmer's productivity? Well, yes. The suggestion presented here is not that you should stop using IDEs. The suggestion is that you should "look under the hood" and understand what your IDE is doing for you. The best way to do that is to learn to use command-line tools. Then, when you go back to using your IDE, you'll have a much better understanding of what it is doing for you and how you can control the build process. On the other hand, once you master the use of command-line tools and experience the power and flexibility that they offer, you may find that you prefer the command line over the IDE.

summary

IDE 很好用，但它隐藏了一些细节。使用命令行工具你会了解每个步骤。有一些任务使用命令行工具可能更容易或更高效，比如自动化任务。
