### Scaling a distributed storage system
The first thing I want to talk about is scaling. The core of a distributed storage system is nothing more than two points: one is the sharding strategy, and the other is metadata storage. Keeping applications transparent and consistent in the sharding process is crucial to a storage system with elastic scalability. 
#### Sharding strategies for distributed databases
1. range-based sharding
2. hash-based sharding
#### Implementing elastic scalability for a storage system

#### Implementing data consistency and high availability

### Scheduling（排程） in a distributed storage system

### PD being completely stateless guarantees routing data consistency
#### The epoch mechanism guarantees the latest information in PD
