#### [The Road to Performance Is Littered with Dirty Code Bombs](https://97-things-every-x-should-know.gitbooks.io/97-things-every-programmer-should-know/content/en/thing_74/)
More often than not, performance tuning(调节) a system requires you to alter code. When we need to alter code, every chunk that is overly complex or highly coupled is a dirty code bomb laying in wait to derail（脱轨） the effort. The first casualty（伤亡） of dirty code will be your schedule. If the way forward is smooth it will be easy to predict when you'll finish. Unexpected encounters with dirty code will make it very difficult to make a sane（合理的） prediction.

Consider the case where you find an execution hot spot. The normal course of action is to reduce the strength of the underlying（基础） algorithm. Let's say you respond to your manager's request for an estimate with an answer of 3-4 hours. As you apply the fix you quickly realize that you've broken a dependent part. Since closely related things are often necessarily coupled, this breakage is most likely expected and accounted for. But what happens if fixing that dependency results in other dependent parts breaking? Furthermore, the farther away the dependency is from the origin, the less likely you are to recognize it as such and account for it in your estimate. All of a sudden your 3-4 hour estimate can easily balloon to 3-4 weeks. Often this unexpected inflation in the schedule happens 1 or 2 days at a time. It is not uncommon to see "quick" refactorings eventually taking several months to complete. In these instances, the damage to the credibility and political capital of the responsible team will range from severe（严重） to terminal. If only we had a tool to help us identify and measure this risk.

In fact, we have many ways of measuring and controlling the degree and depth of coupling and complexity of our code. Software metrics can be used to count the occurrences of specific features in our code. The values of these counts do correlate with code quality. Two of a number of metrics（指标） that measure coupling are fan-in and fan-out. Consider fan-out for classes: It is defined as the number of classes referenced either directly or indirectly from a class of interest. You can think of this as a count of all the classes that must be compiled before your class can be compiled（你的类依赖其他的类）. Fan-in, on the other hand, is a count of all classes that depend upon the class of interest. Knowing fan-out and fan-in we can calculate an instability factor using I = fo / (fi + fo). As I approaches 0, the package becomes more stable. As I approaches 1, the package becomes unstable. Packages that are stable are low risk targets for recoding whereas unstable packages are more likely to be filled with dirty code bombs. The goal in refactoring is to move I closer to 0.

When using metrics one must remember that they are only rules of thumb（经验法则）. Purely on math we can see that increasing fi without changing fo will move I closer to 0. There is, however, a downside to a very large fan-in value in that these class will be more difficult to alter without breaking dependents. Also, without addressing fan-out you're not really reducing your risks so some balance must be applied.

One downside（缺点） to software metrics is that the huge array of numbers that metrics tools produce can be intimidating（惊吓） to the uninitiated（未开始的人）. That said, software metrics can be a powerful tool in our fight for clean code. They can help us to identify（识别） and eliminate（消除） dirty code bombs before they are a serious risk to a performance tuning exercise.

summary

肮脏代码是性能优化的绊脚石。

如何判断一个类 耦合的程度和深度？
-fi fan-in 当前类依赖其他类的数量
-fo fan-out 其他类依赖当前类的数量
I = fo /（fi + fo） I越大，这个类耦合程度高，改动它的话会有很大的风险，

高内聚，低耦合，依赖的东西越少，你的代码就越稳定。

#### [Simplicity Comes from Reduction 简洁来自删减](https://97-things-every-x-should-know.gitbooks.io/97-things-every-programmer-should-know/content/en/thing_75/)
"Do it again...," my boss told me as his finger pressed hard on the delete key. I watched the computer screen with an all too familiar sinking feeling, as my code — line after line — disappeared into oblivion.

My boss, Stefan, wasn't always the most vocal of people, but he knew bad code when he saw it. And he knew exactly what to do with it.

I had arrived in my present position as a student programmer with lots of energy, plenty of enthusiasm but absolutely no idea how to code. I had this horrible tendency to think that the solution to every problem was to add in another variable some place. Or throw in another line. On a bad day, instead of the logic getting better with each revision（修复）, my code gradually got larger, more complex, and farther away from working consistently.

It's natural, particularly when in a rush, to just want to make the most minimal changes to an existing block of code, even if it is awful. Most programmers will preserve bad code, fearing that starting anew will require significantly(显着地) more effort than just going back to the beginning. That can be true for code that is close to working, but there is just some code that is beyond all help(无济于事).

More time gets wasted in trying to salvage（抢救） bad work than it should. Once something becomes a resource sink, it needs to be discarded（丢弃的）. Quickly.

Not that one should easily toss away all of that typing, naming, and formatting. My boss's reaction（反应） was extreme（极端的）, but it did force me to rethink the code on the second (or occasionally third) attempt. Still, the best approach to fixing bad code is to flip into a mode were the code is mercilessly（无情地） refactored, shifted（转移） around, or deleted.

The code should be simple. There should be a minimal number of variables, functions, declarations, and other syntactic language necessities. Extra lines, extra variables... extra anything, really, should be purged（清洗）. Removed immediately. What's there, what's left, should only be just enough to get the job done, completing the algorithm or performing the calculations. Anything and everything else is just extra unwanted noise, introduced accidentally and obscuring the flow（意外引入而使流程模糊）. Hiding the important stuff.

Of course, if that doesn't do it then just delete it all and type it in over again. Drawing from one's memory in that way can often help cut through a lot of unnecessarily clutter（混乱）.

大道至简
#### [The Single Responsibility Principle](https://97-things-every-x-should-know.gitbooks.io/97-things-every-programmer-should-know/content/en/thing_76/)
One of the most foundational principles of good design is:
```
Gather together those things that change for the same reason, and separate those things that change for different reasons.
```
This principle is often known as the Single Responsibility Principle or SRP. In short, it says that a subsystem, module, class, or even a function, should not have more than one reason to change. The classic example is a class that has methods that deal with business rules, reports, and database:
```
public class Employee {
  public Money calculatePay() ...
  public String reportHours() ...
  public void save() ...
}

```
Some programmers might think that putting these three functions together in the same class is perfectly appropriate. After all, classes are supposed to be collections of functions that operate on common variables. However, the problem is that the three functions change for entirely different reasons. The calculatePay function will change whenever the business rules for calculating pay change. The reportHours function will change whenever someone wants a different format for the report. The save function will change whenever the DBAs change the database schema. These three reasons to change combine to make Employee very volatile. It will change for any of those reasons. More importantly, any classes that depend upon Employee will be affected by those changes.

Good system design means that we separate the system into components that can be independently deployed. Independent deployment means that if we change one component we do not have to redeploy any of the others. However, if Employee is heavily used by many other classes in other components, then every change to Employee is likely to cause the other components to be redeployed; thus negating a major benefit of component design (or SOA if you prefer the more trendy name).

```
public class Employee {
  public Money calculatePay() ...
}

public class EmployeeReporter {
  public String reportHours(Employee e) ...
}

public class EmployeeRepository {
  public void save(Employee e) ...
}
```
The simple partitioning shown above resolves the issues. Each of these classes can be placed in a component of its own. Or rather, all the reporting classes can go into the reporting component. All the database related classes can go into the repository component. And all the business rules can go into the business rule component.

The astute（精明的） reader will see that there are still dependencies in the above solution. That Employee is still depended upon by the other classes. So if Employee is modified, the other classes will likely have to be recompiled and redeployed. Thus, Employee cannot be modified and then independently deployed. However, the other classes can be modified and independently deployed. No modification of one of them can force any of the others to be recompiled or redeployed. Even Employee could be independently deployed through a careful use of the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP), but that's a topic for a different book.

Careful application of the SRP, separating things that change for different reasons, is one if the keys to creating designs that have an independently deployable component structure.

summary

单一原则，它表示子系统，模块，类甚至一个功能不应有多个更改理由。将那些由于同一个原因而改动的东西放在一起，将那些由于不同原因而改动的东西分离开来。
