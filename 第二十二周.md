### [What Is a Service Mesh?](https://dzone.com/articles/what-is-a-service-mesh-nginx)
A service mesh is a configurable infrastructure layer for a microservices application. It makes communication among service instances flexible, reliable, and fast. The mesh provides service discovery, load balancing, encryption, authentication and authorization, support for the circuit breaker pattern, and other capabilities.

####  Container orchestration framework.
As more and more containers are added to an application's infrastructure, a separate tool for monitoring and managing the set of containers - a container orchestration framework - becomes essential. Kubernetes seems to have cornered this market, with even its main competitors, Docker Storm and Mesosphere DC/OS, offering an integration with it.
Services vs. service instances. To be precise, what developers create is not a service, but a service definition or service instance template. The app creates service instances from these, and the instances do the actual work.
####  Sidecar proxy. 
A sidecar proxy is a proxy instance that's dedicated to a specific service instance. It communicates with other sidecar proxies and is managed by the orchestration framework.
Service discovery. When an instance needs to interact with a different service, it needs to find - discover - a healthy, available instance of the other service. The service mesh keeps a list, for all services, of the instances that are ready to receive requests.
#### Load balancing. 
In a service mesh, load balancing works from the bottom up. The list of available instances maintained by the service mesh is stack-ranked to put the most available instances - that's the load balancing part - at the top.
#### Encryption.
The service mesh can encrypt and decrypt requests and responses, removing that burden from each of the services. The service mesh also improves performance by prioritizing the re-use of existing, persistent connections, reducing the need for the computationally expensive creation of new ones.
#### Authentication and authorization.
The service mesh can authorize and authenticate requests made from both outside and within the app, sending only validated requests to service instances.
#### Support for the circuit breaker pattern.
The service mesh can support the circuit breaker pattern, which isolates unhealthy instances, then gradually brings them back into the healthy instance pool if warranted.
