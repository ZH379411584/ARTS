#### [Don't Ignore that Error! 不要忽略异常 ](https://97-things-every-x-should-know.gitbooks.io/97-things-every-programmer-should-know/content/en/thing_26/)

```
I was walking down the street one evening to meet some friends in a bar. We hadn't shared a beer in some time and I was looking forward to seeing them again. In my haste, I wasn't looking where I was going. I tripped over the edge of a curb and ended up flat on my face. Well, it serves me right for not paying attention, I guess.

It hurt my leg, but I was in a hurry to meet my friends. So I pulled myself up and carried on. As I walked further the pain was getting worse. Although I'd initially dismissed it as shock, I rapidly realized there was something wrong.
But I hurried on to the bar regardless. I was in agony(痛苦) by the time I arrived. I didn't have a great night out, because I was terribly distracted(分心). In the morning I went to the doctor and found out I'd fractured my shin bone.（我的胫骨骨折） Had I stopped when I felt the pain, I'd've prevented a lot of extra damage that I caused by walking on it. Probably the worst morning after of my life.

```
Too many programmers write code like my disastrous night out. 

Error, what error? It won't be serious. Honestly. I can ignore it. This is not a winning（获胜） strategy for solid code. In fact, it's just plain laziness（懒惰）. (The wrong sort.) No matter how unlikely you think an error is in your code, you should always check for it, and always handle it. Every time. You're not saving time if you don't: You're storing up potential problems for the future.

We report errors in our code in a number of ways, including:

- Return codes can be used as the resulting value of a function to mean "it didn't work." Error return codes are far too easy to ignore. You won't see anything in the code to highlight the problem. Indeed, it's become standard practice to ignore some standard C functions' return values. How often do you check the return value from printf?
- errno is a curious C aberration, a separate global variable set to signal error. It's easy to ignore, hard to use, and leads to all sorts of nasty problems — for example, what happens when you have multiple threads calling the same function? Some platforms insulate you from pain here; others do not.
- Exceptions are a more structured language-supported way of signaling and handling errors. And you can't possibly ignore them. Or can you? I've seen lots of code like this:
```
try {
    // ...do something...
}
catch (...) {} // ignore errors
```
The saving grace of this awful construct is that it highlights the fact you're doing something morally dubious.

If you ignore an error, turn a blind eye, and pretend that nothing has gone wrong, you run great risks. Just as my leg ended up in a worse state than if I'd stopped walking on it immediately, plowing on regardless can lead to very complex failures. Deal with problems at the earliest opportunity. Keep a short account.

Not handling errors leads to:
- Brittle code（易碎代码）. Code that's filled with exciting, hard-to-find bugs.
- Insecure code.（非安全代码） Crackers often exploit poor error handling to break into software systems.
- Poor structure.（结构不良） If there are errors from your code that are tedious to deal with continually, you have probably have a poor interface.）（如果您的代码中有错误需要持续处理，那么您的界面可能很差。） Express it so that the errors are less intrusive and the their handling is less onerous.

Just as you should check all potential errors in your code, you need to expose all potentially erroneous conditions in your interfaces. Do not hide them, pretending that your services will always work.

Why don't we check for errors? There are a number of common excuses. Which of these do you agree with? How would you counter each one?

- Error handling clutters（混乱） up the flow of the code, making it harder to read, and harder to spot the "normal" flow of execution.
- It's extra work and I have a deadline looming.
- I know that this function call will never return an error (printf always works, malloc always returns new memory — if it fails we have bigger problems...).
- It's only a toy program, and needn't be written to a production-worthy level.  
 
#### [Don't Just Learn the Language, Understand its Culture 不只是学习语言，要了解其文化](https://97-things-every-x-should-know.gitbooks.io/97-things-every-programmer-should-know/content/en/thing_27/)

In high school, I had to learn a foreign language. At the time I thought that I'd get by nicely being good at English so I chose to sleep through three years of French class. A few years later I went to Tunisia on vacation. Arabic is the official language there and, being a former French colony, French is also commonly used. English is only spoken in the touristy areas. Because of my linguistic ignorance, I found myself confined at the poolside reading Finnegans Wake, James Joyce's tour de force in form and language.（由于我对语言的无知，我发现自己只能坐在池畔阅读“芬尼根斯·韦克”，这是詹姆斯·乔伊斯的形式和语言之旅。） Joyce's playful blend of more than forty languages was a surprising albeit exhausting experience. Realizing how interwoven foreign words and phrases gave the author new ways of expressing himself is something I've kept with me in my programming career.

In their seminal book（开创的）, The Pragmatic Programmer（实用程序员）, Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas encourage us to learn a new programming language every year. I've tried to live by their advice and throughout the years I've had the experience of programming in many languages. My most important lesson from my polyglot（多种语言） adventures is that it takes more than just learning the syntax（句法） to learn a language: You need to understand its culture. You can write Fortran in any language, but to truly learn a language you have to embrace the language. Don't make excuses if your C# code is a long Main method with mostly static helper methods, but learn why classes make sense. Don't shy away if you have a hard time understanding the lambda expressions used in functional languages, force yourself to use them.

Once you've learned the ropes（精髓） of a new language, you'll be surprised how you'll start using languages you already know in new ways. I learned how to use delegates effectively in C# from programming Ruby, releasing the full potential of .NETs generics gave me ideas on how I could make Java generics more useful, and LINQ made it a breeze to teach myself Scala.
You'll also get a better understanding of design patterns by moving between different languages. C programmers find that C# and Java have commoditized the iterator pattern. In Ruby and other dynamic languages you might still use a visitor, but your implementation won't look like the example from the Gang of Four（四人帮） book.

Some might argue that Finnegans Wake is unreadable, while others applaud it for its stylistic beauty. To make the book a less daunting read, single language translations are available. Ironically, the first of these was in French. Code is in many ways similar. If you write Wakese code with a little Python, some Java, and a hint of Erlang, your projects will be a mess. If you instead explore new languages to expand your mind and get fresh ideas on how you can solve things in different ways, you will find that the code you write in your trusty old language gets more beautiful for every new language you've learned.

#### [Don't Nail Your Program into the Upright Position ](https://97-things-every-x-should-know.gitbooks.io/97-things-every-programmer-should-know/content/en/thing_28/)
I once wrote a spoof C++ quiz, in which I satirically suggested the following strategy for exception handling:
```
By dint of plentiful try...catch constructs throughout our code base, we are sometimes able to prevent our applications from aborting. We think of the resultant state as "nailing the corpse in the upright position."(通过在整个代码库中使用大量try ... catch构造，有时可以防止应用程序中止。我们认为结果状态是“将尸体钉在直立位置”。 )
```
Despite my levity, I was actually summarizing a lesson I received at the knee of Dame Bitter Experience herself. 

It was a base application class in our own, homemade C++ library. It had suffered the pokings of many programmers' fingers over the years: Nobody's hands were clean. It contained code to deal with all escaped exceptions from everything else.（它是我们自己的自制C ++库中的基础应用程序类。这些年来，它遭受了许多程序员的嘲笑：没有人的手是干净的。它包含用于处理其他所有逃逸异常的代码。） Taking our lead from Yossarian in Catch-22, we decided, or rather felt (decided implies more thought than went into the construction of this monster) that an instance of this class should live forever or die in the attempt.

To this end, we intertwined multiple exception handlers. We mixed in Windows' structured exception handling with the native kind (remember __try...__except in C++? Me neither). When things threw unexpectedly, we tried calling them again, pressing the parameters harder. Looking back, I like to think that when writing an inner try...catch handler within the catch clause of another, some sort of awareness crept over me that I might have accidentally taken a slip road from the motorway of good practice into the aromatic but insalubrious lane of lunacy. However, this is probably retrospective wisdom.

Needless to say, whenever something went wrong in applications based on this class, they vanished like Mafia victims at the dockside, leaving behind no useful trail of bubbles to indicate what the hell happened, notwithstanding the dump routines that were supposedly called to record the disaster. Eventually — a long eventually — we took stock of what we had done, and experienced shame. We replaced the whole mess with a minimal and robust reporting mechanism. But this was many crashes down the line.

I wouldn't bother you with this — for surely nobody else could ever be as stupid as we were — but for an online argument I had recently with a bloke whose academic job title declared he should know better. We were discussing Java code in a remote transaction. If the code failed, he argued, it should catch and block the exception in situ. ("And then do what with it?" I asked. "Cook it for supper?")

He quoted the UI designers' rule: NEVER LET THE USER SEE AN EXCEPTION REPORT, rather as though this settled the matter, what with it being in caps and everything. I wonder if he was responsible for the code in one of those blue-screened ATMs whose photos decorate the feebler blogs, and had been permanently traumatized. Anyway, if you should meet him, nod and smile and take no notice, as you sidle towards the door.
