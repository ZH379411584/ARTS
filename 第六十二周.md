#### [Missing Opportunities for Polymorphism](https://97-things-every-x-should-know.gitbooks.io/97-things-every-programmer-should-know/content/en/thing_59/)
Polymorphism is one of the grand ideas that is fundamental to OO. The word, taken from Greek, means many (poly) forms (morph). In the context of programming polymorphism refers to many forms of a particular class of objects or method. But polymorphism isn't simply about alternate implementations. Used carefully, polymorphism creates tiny localized execution contexts that let us work without the need for verbose if-then-else blocks. Being in a context allows us to do the right thing directly, whereas being outside of that context forces us to reconstruct it so that we can then do the right thing. With careful use of alternate implementations, we can capture context that can help us produce less code that is more readable. This is best demonstrated with some code, such as the following (unrealistically) simple shopping cart:
```
public class ShoppingCart {
    private ArrayList<Item> cart = new ArrayList<Item>();
    public void add(Item item) { cart.add(item); }
    public Item takeNext() { return cart.remove(0);  }
    public boolean isEmpty() { return cart.isEmpty(); }
}
```
Let's say our webshop offers items that can be downloaded and items that need to be shipped. Let's build another object that supports these operations:
```
public class Shipping {
    public boolean ship(Item item, SurfaceAddress address) { ... }
    public boolean ship(Item item, EMailAddress address { ... }
}
```
When a client has completed checkout we need to ship the goods:
```
while (!cart.isEmpty()) {
    shipping.ship(cart.takeNext(), ???);
}
```
The ??? parameter isn't some new fancy elvis operator, it's asking should I email or snail-mail the item? The context needed to answer this question no longer exists. We have could captured the method of shipment in a boolean or enum and then use an if-then-else to fill in the missing parameter. Another solution would be create two classes that both extend Item. Let's call these DownloadableItem and SurfaceItem. Now let's write some code. I'll promote Item to be an interface that supports a single method, ship. To ship the contents of the cart, we will call item.ship(shipper). Classes DownloadableItem and SurfaceItem will both implement ship.
```
public class DownloadableItem implements Item {
    public boolean ship(Shipping shipper) {
        shipper.ship(this, customer.getEmailAddress());
    }
}

public class SurfaceItem implements Item {
    public boolean ship(Shipping shipper) {
        shipper.ship(this, customer.getSurfaceAddress());
    }
}
```
In this example we've delegated the responsibility of working with Shipping to each Item. Since each item knows hows it's best shipped, this arrangement allows us to get on with it without the need for an if-then-else. The code also demonstrates a use of two patterns that often play well together: Command and Double Dispatch. Effective use of these patterns relies on careful use of polymorphism. When that happens there will be a reduction in the number of if-then-else blocks in our code.

While there are cases where it's much more practical to use if-then-else instead of polymorphism, it is more often the case that a more polymorphic coding style will yield a smaller, more readable and less fragile code base. The number of missed opportunities is a simple count of the if-then-else statements in our code.

多态性是面向对象的基本思想之一，文中使用状态模式替换if else。一种多态的编码风格将产生一个更小，更易读，更不易碎的代码库。

#### [News of the Weird: Testers Are Your Friends](https://97-things-every-x-should-know.gitbooks.io/97-things-every-programmer-should-know/content/en/thing_60/)
Whether they call themselves Quality Assurance or Quality Control, many programmers call them Trouble. In my experience, programmers often have an adversarial(对抗的) relationship with the people who test their software. "They're too picky" and "They want everything perfect" are common complaints. Sound familiar?

I'm not sure why, but I've always had a different view of testers. Maybe it's because the "tester" at my first job was the company secretary. Margaret was a very nice lady who kept the office running, and tried to teach a couple of young programmers how to behave professionally in front of customers. She also had a gift for finding any bug, no matter how obscure(晦涩), in mere moments.

Back then I was working on a program written by an accountant who thought he was a programmer. Needless to say, it had some serious problems. When I thought I had a piece straightened out, Margaret would try to use it and, more often than not, it would fail in some new way after just a few keystrokes. It was at times frustrating and embarrassing, but she was such a pleasant person that I never thought to blame her for making me look bad. Eventually the day came when Margaret was able to cleanly start the program, enter an invoice, print it, and shut it down. I was thrilled. Even better, when we installed it on our customer's machine it all worked. They never saw any problems because Margaret had helped me find and fix them first.
So that's why I say testers are your friends. You may think the testers make you look bad by reporting trivial issues. But when customers are thrilled because they weren't bothered by all those "little things" that QC made you fix, then you look great. See what I mean?

Imagine this: You're test-driving a utility that uses "ground-breaking(突破性的) artificial intelligence algorithms" to find and fix concurrency problems. You fire it up and immediately notice they misspelled "intelligence" on the splash screen. A little inauspicious(不祥), but it's just a typo(错字), right? Then you notice the configuration screen uses check boxes where there should be radio buttons, and some of the keyboard shortcuts don't work. Now, none of these is a big deal, but as the errors add up you begin to wonder about the programmers. If they can't get the simple things right, what are the odds their AI can really find and fix something tricky like concurrency issues?

They could be geniuses who were so focused on making the AI insanely(疯狂地) great that they didn't notice those trivial (不重要的)things. And without "picky testers" pointing out the problems, you wound up finding them. And now you're questioning the competency of the programmers.

So as strange as it may sound, those testers who seem determined to expose every little bug in your code really are your friends.

#### [One Binary](https://97-things-every-x-should-know.gitbooks.io/97-things-every-programmer-should-know/content/en/thing_61/)
I've seen several projects where the build rewrites some part of the code to generate a custom binary for each target environment. This always makes things more complicated than they should be, and introduces a risk that the team may not have consistent versions on each installation. At a minimum it involves building multiple, near-identical(几乎相同) copies of the software, each of which then has to be deployed to the right place. It means more moving parts than necessary, which means more opportunities to make a mistake.

I once worked on a team where every property change had to be checked in for a full build cycle, so the testers were left waiting whenever they needed a minor adjustment (did I mention that the build took too long as well?). I also worked on a team where the system administrators insisted on rebuilding from scratch(刮) for production (using the same scripts that we did), which meant that we had no proof that the version in production was the one that had been through testing. And so on.

The rule is simple: Build a single binary that you can identify and promote through all the stages in the release pipeline. Hold environment-specific details in the environment. This could mean, for example, keeping them in the component container, in a known file, or in the path.

If your team either has a code-mangling build or stores all the target settings with the code, that suggests that no one has thought through the design carefully enough to separate those features which are core to the application and those which are platform-specific. Or it could be worse: The team knows what to do but can't prioritize the effort to make the change.

Of course, there are exceptions: You might be building for targets that have significantly different resource constraints, but that doesn't apply to the majority of us who are writing "database to screen and back again" applications. Alternatively, you might be living with some legacy mess that's too hard to fix right now. In such cases, you have to move incrementally — but start as soon as possible.

And one more thing: Keep the environment information versioned too. There's nothing worse than breaking an environment configuration and not being able to figure out what changed. The environmental information should be versioned separately from the code, since they'll change at different rates and for different reasons. Some teams use distributed version control systems for this (such as bazaar and git), since they make it easier to push changes made in production environments — as inevitably(不可避免地) happens — back to the repository.
