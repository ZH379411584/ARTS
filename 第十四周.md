### RDB
#### advantage
1. RDB files are perfect for backups.
2. RDB is very good for disaster recovery.
3. RDB allows faster restarts with big datasets compared to AOF.

#### disadvantage 
1. lose the latest minutes of data.
2. RDB needs to fork() often in order to persist on disk using a child process. Fork() can be time consuming if the dataset is big, and may result in Redis to stop serving clients for some millisecond or even for one second if the dataset is very big and the CPU performance not great.
#### how to use ?
```
#
# Save the DB on disk:
#
#   save <seconds> <changes>
#
#   Will save the DB if both the given number of seconds and the given
#   number of write operations against the DB occurred.
#
#   In the example below the behaviour will be to save:
#   after 900 sec (15 min) if at least 1 key changed
#   after 300 sec (5 min) if at least 10 keys changed
#   after 60 sec if at least 10000 keys changed
#
#   Note: you can disable saving completely by commenting out all "save" lines.
#
#   It is also possible to remove all the previously configured save
#   points by adding a save directive with a single empty string argument
#   like in the following example:
#
#   save ""

save 900 1
save 300 10
save 60 10000
```
### AOF
#### advantage
1. Using AOF Redis is much more durable(耐久): you can have different fsync policies: no fsync at all, fsync every second, fsync at every query.
2. The AOF log is an append only log, so there are no seeks, nor corruption problems if there is a power outage. Even if the log ends with an half-written command for some reason (disk full or other reasons) the redis-check-aof tool is able to fix it easily.
3. AOF contains a log of all the operations one after the other in an easy to understand and parse format. You can even easily export an AOF file.
#### disadvantage 
1. AOF files are usually bigger than the equivalent RDB files for the same dataset.
2. exists bug.

#### how to use ?
```
appendonly yes 
appendfsync everysec
```
